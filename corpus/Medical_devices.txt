young, age, le, than, year, have, better, success, with, them, than, congenitally, deaf, child, who, first, receive, the, implant, at, a, later, age, though, the, critical, period, for, utilizing, auditory, information, doe, not, close, completely, until, adolescence, one, doctor, ha, said, there, is, a, time, window, during, which, they, can, get, an, implant, and, learn, to, speak, from, the, age, of, two, to, four, that, ability, diminishes, a, little, bit, and, by, age, nine, there, is, zero, chance, that, they, will, learn, to, speak, properly, so, really, important, that, they, get, recognized, and, evaluated, early, additionally, there, is, another, sensitive, period, for, strong, asymmetry, in, hearing, that, close, earlier, in, life, in, case, of, early, deafness, or, unilateral, cochlear, implantation, the, brain, reorganizes, towards, the, hearing, ear, and, that, put, the, deaf, ear, into, a, disadvantage, consequently, the, benefit, of, a, sequential, second, implantation, on, the, deaf, ear, is, critically, dependent, on, the, delay, between, implantation, period, of, asymmetric, hearing, during, early, childhood, should, be, avoided, and, therapy, of, deafness, should, be, binaural, the, third, group, who, will, benefit, substantially, from, cochlear, implantation, are, subject, who, have, lost, hearing, a, common, cause, is, childhood, meningitis, young, child, under, five, year, in, these, case, often, make, excellent, progress, after, implantation, because, they, have, learned, how, to, form, sound, and, only, need, to, learn, how, to,

and, in, south, korea, by, the, seoul, national, university, hospital, criticism, and, controversy, edit, much, of, the, strongest, objection, to, cochlear, implant, ha, come, from, the, deaf, community, which, consists, largely, of, deaf, people, whose, first, language, is, a, signed, language, for, some, in, the, deaf, community, cochlear, implant, are, an, affront, to, their, culture, which, a, they, view, it, is, a, minority, threatened, by, the, hearing, majority, this, is, an, old, problem, for, the, deaf, community, going, back, a, far, a, the, century, with, the, argument, of, manualism, oralism, this, is, consistent, with, medicalisation, and, the, standardisation, of, the, body, in, the, century, when, difference, between, normal, and, abnormal, began, to, be, debated, despite, the, cochlear, implant, being, justified, from, a, medical, perspective, it, is, also, important, to, consider, the, sociocultural, context, particularly, in, regard, to, the, deaf, community, which, considers, itself, to, posse, it, own, unique, language, and, culture, this, account, for, the, cochlear, implant, being, seen, a, an, affront, to, their, culture, a, many, do, not, believe, that, deafness, is, something, that, need, to, be, cured, however, it, ha, also, been, argued, that, this, doe, not, necessarily, have, to, be, the, case, the, cochlear, implant, can, act, a, a, tool, deaf, people, can, use, to, access, the, world, without, losing, their, deaf, identity, cochlear, implant, for, congenitally, deaf, child, are, considered, to, be, most, effective, when, implanted, at, a, young, age, during, the, critical, period, in, which, the, brain, is, still, learning, to, interpret, sound, hence, they, are, implanted, before, the, recipient, can, decide, for, themselves, on, the, assumption, that, deafness, is, a, disability, deaf, culture, critic, argue, that, the, cochlear, implant, and, the, subsequent, therapy, often, become, the, focus, of, the, child, identity, at, the, expense, of, a, possible, future, deaf, identity, and, ease, of, communication, in, sign, language, and, claim, that, measuring, the, child, success, only, by, their, mastery, of, hearing, and, speech, will, lead, to, a, poor, a, disabled, because, the, implant, do, not, produce, normal, hearing, rather, than, having, the, healthy, of, a, proudly, deaf, person,

the, patient, however, the, use, of, present, a, higher, risk, of, burn, during, defibrillation, since, electrode, more, evenly, conduct, electricity, into, the, body, paddle, electrode, which, were, the, first, type, developed, come, without, gel, and, must, have, the, gel, applied, in, a, separate, step, electrode, come, prefitted, with, gel, there, is, a, general, division, of, opinion, over, which, type, of, electrode, is, superior, in, hospital, setting, the, american, heart, association, favor, neither, and, all, modern, manual, defibrillator, used, in, hospital, allow, for, swift, switching, between, pad, and, traditional, paddle, each, type, of, electrode, ha, it, merit, and, demerit, a, discussed, below, paddle, electrode, edit, a, pair, of, defibrillator, paddle, the, most, type, of, electrode, widely, depicted, in, film, and, television, is, the, traditional, metal, paddle, with, an, insulated, usually, plastic, handle, this, type, must, be, held, in, place, on, the, patient, skin, with, approximately, lb, of, force, while, a, shock, or, a, series, of, shock, is, delivered, paddle, offer, a, few, advantage, over, pad, many, hospital, in, the, united, state, continue, the, use, of, paddle, with, disposable, gel, pad, attached, in, most, case, due, to, the, inherent, speed, with, which, these, electrode, can, be, placed, and, used, this, is, critical, during, cardiac, arrest, a, each, second, of, nonperfusion, mean, tissue, loss, modern, paddle, allow, for, monitoring, electrocardiography, though, in, hospital, situation, separate, monitoring, lead, are, often, already, in, place, paddle, are, reusable, being, cleaned, after, use, and, stored, for, the, next, patient, gel, is, therefore, not, preapplied, and, must, be, added, before, these, paddle, are, used, on, the, patient, paddle, are, generally, only, found, on, manual, external, unit, electrode, edit, newer, type, of, resuscitation, electrode, are, designed, a, an, adhesive, pad, which, includes, either, solid, or, wet, gel, these, are, peeled, off, their, backing, and, applied, to, the, patient, chest, when, deemed, necessary, much, the, same, a, any, other, sticker, the, electrode, are, then, connected, to, a, defibrillator, much, a, the, paddle, would, be, if, defibrillation, is, required, the, machine, is, charged, and, the, shock, is, delivered, without, any, need, to, apply, any, additional, gel, or, to, retrieve, and, place, any, paddle, most, adhesive, electrode, are, designed, to, be, used, not, only, for, defibrillation, but, also, for, transcutaneous, pacing, and, synchronized, electrical, cardioversion, these, adhesive, pad, are, found, on, most, automated, and, unit, and, are, replacing, paddle, entirely, in, setting, in, hospital, for, case, where, cardiac, arrest, is, likely, to, occur, but, ha, not, yet, pad, may, be, placed, prophylactically, pad, also, offer, an, advantage, to, the, untrained, user, and, to, medic, working, in, the, condition, of, the, field, pad, do, not, require, extra, lead, to, be, attached, for, monitoring, and, they, do, not, require, any, force, to, be, applied, a, the, shock, is, delivered, thus, adhesive, electrode, minimize, the, risk, of, the, operator, coming, into, physical, and, thus, electrical, contact, with, the, patient, a, the, shock, is, delivered, by, allowing, the, operator, to, be, up, to, several, foot, away, the, risk, of, electrical, shock, to, others, remains, unchanged, a, doe, that, of, shock, due, to, operator, misuse, electrode, are, only, they, may, be, used, for, multiple, shock, in, a, single, course, of, treatment, but, are, replaced, if, or, in, case, the, patient, recovers, then, reenters, cardiac, arrest, placement, edit, placement, of, electrode, for, defibrillation, resuscitation, electrode, are, placed, according, to, one, of, two, scheme, the, scheme, is, the, preferred, scheme, for, electrode, placement, one, electrode, is, placed, over, the, left, precordium, the, lower, part, of, the, chest, in, front, of, the, heart, the, other, electrode, is, placed, on, the, back, behind, the, heart, in, the, region, between, the, scapula, this, placement, is, preferred, because, it, is, best, for, pacing, the, scheme, can, be, used, when, the, scheme, is, inconvenient, or, unnecessary, in, this, scheme, the, anterior, electrode, is, placed, on, the, right, below, the, clavicle, the, apex, electrode, is, applied, to, the, left, side, of, the, patient, just, below, and, to, the, left, of, the, pectoral, muscle, this, scheme, work, well,

defibrillator, are, often, depicted, in, movie, television, video, game, and, other, fictional, medium, their, function, however, is, often, exaggerated, with, the, defibrillator, inducing, a, sudden, violent, jerk, or, convulsion, by, the, patient, in, reality, although, the, muscle, may, contract, such, dramatic, patient, presentation, is, rare, similarly, medical, provider, are, often, depicted,

arrest, rhythm, ventricular, fibrillation, and, pulseless, ventricular, tachycardia, are, normally, defibrillated, this, is, because, the, whole, point, of, the, exercise, is, to, shock, the, patient, into, asystole, and, then, let, their, heart, start, back, beating, normally, someone, who, is, already, in, asystole, can, not, be, helped, by, electrical, mean, and, usually, need, urgent, cpr, and,

medical, professional, some, of, these, device, can, be, remotely, controlled, this, ha, engendered, concern, about, privacy, and, security, issue, around, human, error, and, technical, glitch, with, this, technology, while, only, a, few, study, have, looked, at, the, susceptibility, of, medical, device, to, hacking, there, is, a, risk, in, computer, scientist, proved, that, pacemaker, and, defibrillator, can, be, hacked, wirelessly, via, radio, hardware, an, antenna, and, a, personal, computer, these, researcher, showed, they, could, shut, down, a, combination, heart, defibrillator, and, pacemaker, and, reprogram, it, to, deliver, potentially, lethal, shock, or, run, out, it, battery, jay, radcliff, a, security, researcher, interested, in, the, security, of, medical, device, raised, fear, about, the, safety, of, these, device, he, shared, his, concern, at, the, black, hat, security, conference, radcliff, fear, that, the, device, are, vulnerable, and, ha, found, that, a, lethal, attack, is, possible, against, those, with, insulin, pump, and, glucose, monitor, some, medical, device, maker, downplay, the, threat, from, such, attack, and, argue, that, the, demonstrated, attack, have, been, performed, by, skilled, security, researcher, and, are, unlikely, to, occur, in, the, real, world, at, the, same, time, other, maker, have, asked, software, security, expert, to, investigate, the, safety, of, their, device, a, recently, a, june, security, expert, showed, that, by, using, readily, available, hardware, and, a, user, manual, a, scientist, could, both, tap, into, the, information, on, the, system, of, a, wireless, insulin, pump, in, combination, with, a, glucose, monitor, with, the, pin, of, the, device, the, scientist, could, wirelessly, control, the, dosage, of, the, insulin, anand, raghunathan, a, researcher, in, this, study, explains, that, medical, device, are, getting, smaller, and, lighter, so, that, they, can, be, easily, worn, the, downside, is,

computer, aided, manufacturing, software, over, the, year, there, have, been, advancement, in, artificial, limb, new, plastic, and, other, material, such, a, carbon, fiber, have, allowed, artificial, limb, to, be, stronger, and, lighter, limiting, the, amount, of, extra, energy, necessary, to, operate, the, limb, this, is, especially, important, for, transfemoral, amputee, additional, material, have, allowed, artificial, limb, to, look, much, more, realistic, which, is, important, to, transradial, and, transhumeral, amputee, because, they, are, more, likely, to, have, the, artificial, limb, exposed, manufacturing, a, prosthetic, finger, in, addition, to, new, material, the, use, of, electronics, ha, become, very, common, in, artificial, limb, myoelectric, limb, which, control, the, limb, by, converting, muscle, movement, to, electrical, signal, have, become, much, more, common, than, cable, operated, limb, myoelectric, signal, are, picked, up, by, electrode, the, signal, get, integrated, and, once, it, exceeds, a, certain, threshold, the, prosthetic, limb, control, signal, is, triggered, which, is, why, inherently, all, myoelectric, control, lag, conversely, cable, control, is, immediate, and, physical, and, through, that, offer, a, certain, degree, of, direct, force, feedback, that, myoelectric, control, doe, not, computer, are, also, used, extensively, in, the, manufacturing, of, limb, computer, aided, design, and, computer, aided, manufacturing, are, often, used, to, assist, in, the, design, and, manufacture, of, artificial, limb, most, modern, artificial, limb, are, attached, to, the, stump, of, the, amputee, by, belt, and, cuff, or, by, suction, the, stump, either, directly, fit, into, a, socket, on, the, prosthetic, commonly, liner, is, used, that, then, is, fixed, to, the, socket, either, by, vacuum, suction, socket, or, a, pin, lock, liner, are, soft, and, by, that, they, can, create, a, far, better, suction, fit, than, hard, socket, silicone, liner, can, be, obtained, in, standard, size, mostly, with, a, circular, round, cross, section, but, for, any, other, stump, shape, custom, liner, can, be, made, the, socket, is, custom, made, to, fit, the, residual, limb, and, to, distribute, the, force, of, the, artificial, limb, across, the, area, of, the, stump, rather, than, just, one, small, spot, which, help, reduce, wear, on, the, stump, the, custom, socket, is, created, by, taking, a, plaster, cast, of, the, stump, or, more, commonly, today, of, the, liner, worn, over, the, stump, and, then, making, a, mold, from, the, plaster, cast, newer, method, include, laser, guided, measuring, which, can, be, input, directly, to, a, computer, allowing, for, a, more, sophisticated, design, one, problem, with, the, stump, and, socket, attachment, is, that, a, bad, fit, will, reduce, the, area, of, contact, between, the, stump, and, socket, or, liner, and, increase, pocket, between, stump, skin, and, socket, or, liner, pressure, then, is, higher, which, can, be, painful, air, pocket, can, allow, sweat, to, accumulate, that, can, soften, the, skin, ultimately, this, is, a, frequent, cause, for, itchy, skin, rash, further, down, the, road, it, can, cause, breakdown, of, the, skin, artificial, limb, are, typically, manufactured, using, the, following, step, measurement, of, the, stump, measurement, of,

targeted, muscle, reinnervation, tmr, is, a, technique, in, which, motor, nerve, which, previously, controlled, muscle, on, an, amputated, limb, are, surgically, rerouted, such, that, they, reinnervate, a, small, region, of, a, large, intact, muscle, such, a, the, pectoralis, major, a, a, result, when, a, patient, think, about, moving, the, thumb, of, his, missing, hand, a, small, area, of, muscle, on, his, chest, will, contract, instead, by, placing, sensor, over, the, reinervated, muscle, these, contraction, can, be, made, to, control, movement, of, an, appropriate, part, of, the, robotic, prosthesis, a, variant, of, this, technique, is, called, targeted, sensory, reinnervation, tsr, this, procedure, is, similar, to, tmr, except, that, sensory, nerve, are, surgically, rerouted, to, skin, on, the, chest, rather, than, motor, nerve, rerouted, to, muscle, recently, robotic, limb, have, improved, in, their, ability, to, take, signal, from, the, human, brain, and, translate, those, signal, into, motion, in, the, artificial, limb, darpa, the, research, division, is, working, to, make, even, more, advancement, in, this, area, their, desire, is, to, create, an, artificial, limb, that, tie, directly, into, the, nervous, system, robotic, arm, edit, advancement, in, the, processor, used, in, myoelectric, arm, ha, allowed, developer, to, make, gain, in, fine, tuned, control, of, the, prosthetic, the, boston, digital, arm, is, a, recent, artificial, limb, that, ha, taken, advantage, of, these, more, advanced, processor, the, arm, allows, movement, in, five, ax, and, allows, the, arm, to, be, programmed, for, a, more, customized, feel, recently, the, hand, invented, in, edinburgh, scotland, by, david, gow, ha, become, the, first, commercially, available, hand, prosthesis, with, five, individually, powered, digit, the, hand, also, posse, a, manually, rotatable, thumb, which, is, operated, passively, by, the, user, and, allows, the, hand, to, grip, in, precision, power, and, key, grip, mode, another, neural, prosthetic, is, john, hopkins, university, applied, physic, laboratory, proto, besides, the, proto, the, university, also, finished, the, proto, in, early, in, max, ortiz, catalan, and, rickard, of, the, chalmers, university, of, technology, and, sahlgrenska, university, hospital, in, sweden, succeeded, in, making, the, first, robotic, arm, which, is, and, can, be, permanently, attached, to, the, body, using, osseointegration, an, approach, that, is, very, useful, is, called, arm, rotation, which, is, common, for, unilateral, amputee, which, is, an, amputation, that, affect, only, one, side, of, the, body, and, also, essential, for, bilateral, amputee, a, person, who, is, missing, or, ha, had, amputated, either, both, arm, or, leg, to, perform, task, of, daily, living, this, involves, inserting, a, small, permanent, magnet, into, the, distal, end, of, the, residual, bone, of, subject, with, upper, limb, amputation, when, a, subject, rotates, the, residual, arm, the, magnet, will, rotate, with, the, residual, bone, causing, a, change, in, magnetic, field, distribution, eeg, signal, which, is, electroencephalogram, a, test, that, detects, electrical, activity, in, the, brain, using, small, flat, metal, disc, attached, to, your, scalp, essentially, decoding, human, brain, activity, used, for, physical, movement, are, used, to, control, the, robotic, limb, this, is, very, essential, being, that, it, provides, a, more, lively, affect, to, the, robotic, limb, giving, oneself, control,

targeted, to, replace, the, wheelchair, it, is, marketed, a, a, robotic, pant, walk, again, project, is, developing, a, similar, device, attachment, to, the, body, edit, most, prosthesis, can, be, attached, to, the, exterior, of, the, body, in, a, way, some, others, however, can, be, attached, in, a, permanent, way, one, such, example, are, exoprostheses, see, below, direct, bone, attachment, and, osseointegration, edit, main, article, osseointegration, osseointegration, is, a, method, of, attaching, the, artificial, limb, to, the, body, this, method, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, a, exoprosthesis, attaching, an, artificial, limb, to, the, bone, or, the, stump, and, socket, method, can, cause, significant, pain, in, the, amputee, which, is, why, the, direct, bone, attachment, ha, been, explored, extensively, the, method, work, by, inserting, a, titanium, bolt, into, the, bone, at, the, end, of, the, stump, after, several, month, the, bone, attache, itself, to, the, titanium, bolt, and, an, abutment, is, attached, to, the, titanium, bolt, the, abutment, extends, out, of, the, stump, and, the, removable, artificial, limb, is, then, attached, to, the, abutment, some, of, the, benefit, of, this, method, include, the, following, better, muscle, control, of, the, prosthetic, the, ability, to, wear, the, prosthetic, for, an, extended, period, of, time, with, the, stump, and, socket, method, this, is, not, possible, the, ability, for, transfemoral, amputee, to, drive, a, car, the, main, disadvantage, of, this, method, is, that, amputee, with, the, direct, bone, attachment, can, not, have, large, impact, on, the, limb, such, a, those, experienced, during, jogging, because, of, the, potential, for, the, bone, to, break, cosmesis, edit, cosmetic, prosthesis,

development, of, several, other, implantable, device, for, stimulation, of, the, visual, pathway, including, retinal, implant, retinal, stimulation, device, in, particular, have, become, a, focus, of, research, a, approximately, half, of, all, case, of, blindness, are, caused, by, retinal, damage, the, development, of, retinal, implant, ha, also, been, motivated, in, part, by, the, advancement, and, success, of, cochlear, implant, which, ha, demonstrated, that, human, can, regain, significant, sensory, function, with, limited, input, the, argus, ii, retinal, implant, ha, received, market,

in, europe, and, wa, awarded, a, ce, mark, in, making, it, the, first, wireless, epiretinal, device, to, gain, approval, candidate, edit, optimal, candidate, for, retinal, implant, have, retinal, disease, such, a, retinitis, pigmentosa, or, macular, degeneration, these, disease, cause, blindness, by, affecting, the, photoreceptor, cell, in, the, outer, layer, of, the, retina, while, leaving, the, inner, and, middle, retinal, layer, intact, minimally, a, patient, must, have, an, intact, ganglion, cell, layer, in, order, to, be, a, candidate, for, a, retinal, implant, this, can, be, assessed, using, optical, coherence, tomography, oct, imaging, other, factor, including, the, amount, of, residual, vision, overall, health, and, family, commitment, to, rehabilitation, are, also, considered, when, determining, candidate, for, retinal, implant, in, subject, with, macular, degeneration, who, may, have, intact, peripheral, vision, retinal, implant, could, result, in, a, hybrid, form, of, vision, in, this, case, the, implant, would, supplement, the, remaining, peripheral, vision, with, central, vision, information, type, of, retinal, implant, edit, there, are, two, main, type, of, retinal, implant, epiretinal, implant, are, placed, in, the, internal, surface, of, the, retina, while, subretinal, implant, are, placed, between, the, outer, retinal, layer, and, the, retinal, pigment, epithelium, epiretinal, implant, edit, design, principle, edit, epiretinal, implant, sit, in, the, inner, surface, of, the, retina, directly, stimulating, ganglion, cell, and, bypassing, all, other, retinal, layer, epiretinal, implant, consist, of, a, silicon, platinum, electrode, array, mounted, onto, the, inner, retinal, layer, the, array, is, stabilized, using, micro, tack, along, with, the, slight, mechanical, pressure, provided, by, the, vitreous, humour, the, epiretinal, implant, requires, an, external, video, camera, to, acquire, image, the, camera, receives, an, image, of, the, surrounding, environment, process, the, image, and, communicates, the, image, information, to, the, implanted, electrode, array, wirelessly, via, telemetry, an, external, transmitter, is, also, required, to, provide, continuous, power, to, the, implant, via, induction, coil, or, infrared, laser, the, external, camera, and, image, processing, chip, are, generally, mounted, onto, eyeglass, for, the, patient, the, image, processing, involves, reducing, the, resolution, of, the, image, and, converting, the, image, into, a, spatial, and, temporal, pattern, of, stimulation, to, activate, the, appropriate, retinal, cell, the, epiretinal, implant, system, must, be, capable, of, processing, image, in, real, time, to, prevent, any, noticeable, delay, between, the, camera, input, and, retinal, stimulation, which, could, confound, visual, perception, the, processing, chip, may, also, need, to, perform, additional, function, such, a, motion, and, edge, detection, advantage, edit, epiretinal, implant, are, advantageous, a, they, bypass, a, large, portion, of, the, retina, relying, on, the, function, of, ganglion, cell, in, the, innermost, layer, of, the, retina, therefore, epiretinal, implant, could, provide, visual, perception, to, individual, with, retinal, disease, extending, beyond, the, photoreceptor, layer, the, majority, of, electronics, can, be, incorporated, into, the, associated, external, component, allowing, for, a, smaller, implant, and, simpler, upgrade, without, additional, surgery, the, external, electronics, also, allow, a, doctor, to, have, full, control, over, the, image, processing, and, adapt, the, processing, for, each, patient, additionally, the, location, of, epiretinal, implant, allows, the, vitreous, humor, to, serve, a, a, heat, sink, for, the, implant, disadvantage, edit, the, main, disadvantage, of, epiretinal, implant, is, the, need, for, an, external, apparatus, which, can, be, cumbersome, to, wear, the, external, camera, also, requires, a, subject, to, make, head, movement, in, order, to, change, their, gaze, epiretinal, implant, can, stimulate, not, only, ganglion, cell, body, but, also, the, nearby, axon, which, may, be, associated, with, other, retinotopic, area, this, can, result, in, a, slightly, distorted, stimulation, pattern, which, must, be, corrected, during, electronic, processing, additionally, stimulation, at, the, ganglion, cell, layer, requires, more, sophisticated, image, processing, technique, in, order, to, account, for, the, normal, processing, associated, with, the, bypassed, retinal, layer, while, an, epiretinal, implant, can, be, stabilized, by, the, pressure, of, the, vitreous, humour, mechanical, fixation, using, microtacks, may, be, required, to, further, stabilize, the, implant, onto, the, inner, retinal, layer, clinical, study, edit, the, first, epiretinal, implant, the, argus, device, included, a, silicon, platinum, array, with, electrode, the, phase, i, clinical, trial, of, argus, began, in, by, implanting, six, participant, with, the, device, all, patient, reported, gaining, a, perception, of, light, and, discrete, phosphenes, with, the, visual, function, of, some, patient, improving, significantly, over, time, future, version, of, the, argus, device, are, being, developed, with, increasingly, dense, electrode, array, allowing, for, improved, spatial, resolution, the, most, recent, argus, ii, device, contains, electrode, and, a, electrode, device, is, under, development, by, ophthalmologist, and, engineer, at, the, usc, eye, institute, the, argus, ii, device, received, marketing, approval, in, february, ce, mark, demonstrating, safety, and, performance, and, it, is, available, in, germany, france, italy, and, uk, interim,

retinal, implant, ha, been, developed, by, iip, technology, gmbh, and, ha, begun, to, be, evaluated, in, clinical, trial, a, third, epiretinal, device, ha, been, developed, and, progressed, to, clinical, testing, in, six, patient, the, device, contains, electrode, and, requires, the, crystalline, lens, to, be, replaced, with, a, receiver, chip, all, subject, have, demonstrated, the, ability, to, discriminate, between, different, spatial, and, temporal, pattern, of, stimulation, subretinal, implant, edit, design, principle, edit, subretinal, implant, sit, on, the, outer, surface, of, the, retina, between, the, photoreceptor, layer, and, the, retinal, pigment, epithelium, directly, stimulating, retinal, cell, and, relying, on, the, normal, processing, of, the, inner, and, middle, retinal, layer, adhering, a, subretinal, implant, in, place, is, relatively, simple, a, the, implant, is, mechanically, constrained, by, the, minimal, distance, between, the, outer, retina, and, the, retinal, pigment, epithelium, a, subretinal, implant, consists, of, a, silicon, wafer, containing, light, sensitive, microphotodiodes, which, generate, signal, directly, from, the, incoming, light, incident, light, passing, through, the, retina, generates, current, within, the, microphotodiodes, which, directly, inject, the, resultant, current, into, the, underlying, retinal, cell, via, array, of, microelectrodes, the, pattern, of, microphotodiodes, activated, by, incident, light, therefore, stimulates, a, pattern, of, bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and, ganglion, cell, leading, to, a, visual, perception, representative, of, the, original, incident, image, in, principle, subretinal, implant, do, not, require, any, external, hardware, beyond, the, implanted, microphotodiodes, array, however, some, subretinal, implant, require, power, from, external, circuitry, to, enhance, the, image, signal, advantage, edit, a, subretinal, implant, is, advantageous, over, an, epiretinal, implant, in, part, because, of, it, simpler, design, the, light, acquisition, processing, and, stimulation, are, all, carried, out, by, microphotodiodes, mounted, onto, a, single, chip, a, opposed, to, the, external, camera, processing, chip, and, implanted, electrode, array, associated, with, an, epiretinal, implant, the, subretinal, placement, is, also, more, straightforward, a, it, place, the, stimulating, array, directly, adjacent, to, the, damaged, photoreceptors, by, relying, on, the, function, of, the, remaining, retinal, layer, subretinal, implant, allow, for, normal, inner, retinal, processing, including, amplification, thus, resulting, in, an, overall, lower, threshold, for, a, visual, response, additionally, subretinal, implant, enable, subject, to, use, normal, eye, movement, to, shift, their, gaze, the, retinotopic, stimulation, from, subretinal, implant, is, inherently, more, accurate, a, the, pattern, of, incident, light, on, the, microphotodiodes, is, a, direct, reflection, of, the, desired, image, subretinal, implant, require, minimal, fixation, a, the, subretinal, space, is, mechanically, constrained, and, the, retinal, pigment, epithelium, creates, negative, pressure, within, the, subretinal, space, disadvantage, edit, the, main, disadvantage, of, subretinal, implant, is, the, lack, of, sufficient, incident, light, to, enable, the, microphotodiodes, to, generate, adequate, current, thus, subretinal, implant, often, incorporate, an, external, power, source, to, amplify, the, effect, of, incident, light, the, compact, nature, of, the, subretinal, space, imposes, significant, size, constraint, on, the, implant, the, close, proximity, between, the, implant, and, the, retina, also, increase, the, possibility, of, thermal, damage, to, the, retina, from, heat, generated, by, the, implant, subretinal, implant, require, intact, inner, and, middle, retinal, layer, and, therefore, are, not, beneficial, for, retinal, disease, extending, beyond, the, outer, photoreceptor, layer, additionally, photoreceptor, loss, can, result, in, the, formation, of, a, membrane, at, the, boundary, of, the, damaged, photoreceptors, which, can, impede, stimulation, and, increase, the, stimulation, threshold, clinical, study, edit, optobionics, wa, the, first, company, to, develop, a, subretinal, implant, and, evaluate, the, design, in, a, clinical, trial, initial, report, indicated, that, the, implantation, procedure, wa, safe, and, all, subject, reported, some, perception, of, light, and, mild, improvement, in, visual, function, the, current, version, of, this, device, ha, been, implanted, in, patient, who, have, each, reported, improvement, in, the, perception, of, visual, detail, including, contrast, shape, and, movement, retina, implant, ag, in, germany, ha, also, developed, a, subretinal, implant, which, ha, undergone, clinical, testing, in, nine, patient, trial, wa, put, on, hold, due, to, repeated, failure, the, retina, implant, ag, device, contains, microphotodiodes, allowing, for, increased, spatial, resolution, but, requires, an, external, power, source, retina, implant, ag, reported, month, result, on, the, alpha, ims, study, in, feb, showing, that, six, out, of, nine, patient, had, a, device, failure, in, the, nine, month, post, implant, proceeding, of, the, royal, society, b, and, that, five, of, the, eight, subject, reported, various, visual, perception, in, daily, life, one, had, optic, nerve, damage, and, did, not, perceive, stimulation, the, boston, subretinal, implant, project, ha, also, developed, several, iteration, of, a, functional, subretinal, implant, and, focused, on, short, term, analysis, of, implant, function, result, from, all, clinical, trial, to, date, indicate, that, patient, receiving, subretinal, implant, report, perception, of, phosphenes, with, some, gaining, the, ability, to, perform, basic, visual, task, such, a, shape, recognition, and, motion, detection, spatial, resolution, edit, the, quality, of, vision, expected, from, a, retinal, implant, is, largely, based, on, the, maximum, spatial, resolution, of, the, implant, current, prototype, of, retinal, implant, are, capable, of, providing, low, resolution, pixelated, image, the, of, the, retinal, implant, incorporate, channel, which, is, sufficient, for, basic, object, discrimination, and, recognition, task, however, simulation, of, the, resultant, pixelated, image, assume, that, all, electrode, on, the, implant, are, in, contact, with, the, desired, retinal, cell, therefore, the, expected, spatial, resolution, provided, is, even, lower, a, a, few, of, the, electrode, may, not, function, optimally, test, of, reading, performance, indicated, that, a, channel, implant, is, sufficient, to, restore, some, reading, ability, but, only, with, significantly, enlarged, text, similar, experiment, evaluating, room, navigation, ability, with, pixelated, image, demonstrated, that, channel, were, sufficient, for, experienced, subject, while, subject, required, channel, this, experiment, therefore, not, only, demonstrated, the, functionality, provided, by, low, resolution, visual, feedback, but, also, the, ability, for, subject, to, adapt, and, improve, over, time, however, these, experiment, are, based, merely, on, simulation, of, low, resolution, vision, in, normal, subject, rather, than, clinical, testing, of, implanted, subject, the, number, of, electrode, necessary, for, reading, or, room, navigation, may, differ, in, implanted, subject, and, further, testing, need, to, be, conducted, within, this, clinical, population, to, determine, the, required, spatial, resolution, for, specific, visual, task, simulation, result, indicate, that, electrode, would, be, required, to, enable, subject, to, perform, a, wide, variety, of, task, including, reading, face, recognition, and, navigating, around, room, thus, the, available, spatial, resolution, of, retinal, implant, need, to, increase, by, a, factor, of, while, remaining, small, enough, to, implant, to, restore, sufficient, visual, function, for, those, task, current, status, and, future, development, edit, clinical, report, to, date, have, demonstrated, mixed, success, with, all, patient, report, at, least, some, sensation, of, light, from, the, electrode, and, a, smaller, proportion, gaining, more, detailed, visual, function, such, a, identifying, pattern, of, light, and, dark, area, the, clinical, report, indicate, that, even, with, low, resolution, retinal, implant, are, potentially, useful, in, providing, crude, vision, to, individual, who, otherwise, would, not, have, any, visual, sensation, however, clinical, testing, in, implanted, subject, is, somewhat, limited, and, the, majority, of, spatial, resolution, simulation, experiment, have, been, conducted, in, normal, control, it, remains, unclear, whether, the, low, level, vision, provided, by, current, retinal, implant, is, sufficient, to, balance, the, risk, associated, with, the, surgical, procedure, especially, for, subject, with, intact, peripheral, vision, several, other, aspect, of, retinal, implant, need, to, be, addressed, in, future, research, including, the, long, term, stability, of, the, implant, and, the, possibility, of, retinal, neuron, plasticity, in, response, to, prolonged, stimulation, the,
