contaminated, with, a, fungus, and, that, the, colony, of, staphylococci, immediately, surrounding, the, fungus, had, been, destroyed, whereas, other, staphylococci, colony, farther, away, were, normal, famously, remarking, that, funny, fleming, showed, the, contaminated, culture, to, his, former, assistant, merlin, price, who, reminded, him, that, how, you, discovered, lysozyme, fleming, grew, the, mould, in, a, pure, culture, and, found, that, it, produced, a, substance, that, killed, a, number, of, bacteria, he, identified, the, mould, a, being, from, the, penicillium, genus, and, after, some, month, of, calling, it, mould, juice, named, the, substance, it, released, penicillin, on, march, the, laboratory, in, which, fleming, discovered, and, tested, penicillin, is, preserved, a, the, alexander, fleming, laboratory, museum, in, mary, hospital, paddington, he, investigated, it, positive, effect, on, many, organism, and, noticed, that, it, affected, bacteria, such, a,

difficult, and, that, after, having, grown, the, mould, it, wa, even, more, difficult, to, isolate, the, antibiotic, agent, fleming, impression, wa, that, because, of, the, problem, of, producing, it, in, quantity, and, because, it, action, appeared, to, be, rather, slow, penicillin, would, not, be, important, in, treating, infection, fleming, also, became, convinced, that, penicillin, would, not, last, long, enough, in, the, human, body, in, vivo, to, kill, bacteria, effectively, many, clinical, test, were, inconclusive, probably, because, it, had, been, used, a, a, surface, antiseptic, in,

rule, is, try, not, to, use, too, many, of, them, inappropriate, antibiotic, treatment, and, overuse, of, antibiotic, have, contributed, to, the, emergence, of, bacteria, self, prescription, of, antibiotic, is, an, example, of, misuse, many, antibiotic, are, frequently, prescribed, to, treat, symptom, or, disease, that, do, not, respond, to, antibiotic, or, that, are, likely, to, resolve, without, treatment, also, incorrect, or, suboptimal, antibiotic, are, prescribed, for, certain, bacterial, infection, the, overuse, of, antibiotic, like, penicillin, and, erythromycin, ha, been, associated, with, emerging, antibiotic, resistance, since, the, widespread, usage, of, antibiotic, in, hospital, ha, also, been, associated, with, increase, in, bacterial, strain, and, specie, that, no, longer, respond, to, treatment, with, the, most, common, antibiotic, common, form, of, antibiotic, misuse, include, excessive, use, of, prophylactic, antibiotic, in, traveler, and, failure, of,

alexander, fleming, in, before, the, early, century, treatment, for, infection, were, based, primarily, on, medicinal, folklore, mixture, with, antimicrobial, property, that, were, used, in, treatment, of, infection, were, described, over, year, ago, many, ancient, culture, including, the, ancient, egyptian, and, ancient, greek, used, specially, selected, mold, and, plant, material, and, extract, to, treat, infection, more, recent, observation, made, in, the, laboratory, of, antibiosis, between, microorganism, led, to, the, discovery, of, natural, antibacterial, produced, by, microorganism, louis, pasteur, observed, if, we, could, intervene, in, the, antagonism, observed, between, some, bacteria, it, would, offer, perhaps, the, greatest, hope, for, therapeutic, the, term, meaning, against, life, wa, introduced, by, the, french, bacteriologist, jean, paul, vuillemin, a, a, descriptive, name, of, the, phenomenon, exhibited, by, these, early, antibacterial, drug, antibiosis, wa, first, described, in, in, bacteria, when, louis, pasteur, and, robert, koch, observed, that, an, airborne, bacillus, could, inhibit, the, growth, of, bacillus, anthracis, these, drug, were, later, renamed, antibiotic, by, selman, waksman, an, american, microbiologist, in, synthetic, antibiotic, chemotherapy, a, a, science, and, development, of, antibacterial, began, in, germany, with, paul, ehrlich, in, the, late, ehrlich, noted, certain, dye, would, color, human, animal, or, bacterial, cell, whereas, others, did, not, he, then, proposed, the, idea, that, it, might, be, possible, to, create, chemical, that, would, act, a, a, selective, drug, that, would, bind, to, and, kill, bacteria, without, harming, the, human, host, after, screening, hundred, of, dye, against, various, organism, in, he, discovered, a, medicinally, useful, drug, the, synthetic, antibacterial, salvarsan, now, called, arsphenamine, the, effect, of, some, type, of, mold, on, infection, had, been, noticed, many, time, over, the, course, of, history, see, history, of, penicillin, in, alexander, fleming, noticed, the, same, effect, in, a, petri, dish, where, a, number, of, bacteria, were, killed, by, a, fungus, of, the, genus, penicillium, fleming, postulated, that, the, effect, is, mediated, by, an, antibacterial, compound, he, named, penicillin, and, that, it, antibacterial, property, could, be, exploited, for, chemotherapy, he, initially, characterized, some, of, it, biological, property, and, attempted, to, use, a, crude, preparation, to, treat, some, infection, but, he, wa, unable, to, pursue, it, further, development, without, the, aid, of, trained, chemist, alexander, fleming, the, first, sulfonamide, and, first, commercially, available, antibacterial,

by, biological, constituent, such, a, pu, unlike, the, synthetic, sulfonamide, the, discovery, of, such, a, powerful, antibiotic, wa, unprecedented, and, the, development, of, penicillin, led, to, renewed, interest, in, the, search, for, antibiotic, compound, with, similar, efficacy, and, safety, for, their, successful, development, of, penicillin, which, fleming, had, accidentally, discovered, but, could, not, develop, himself, a, a, therapeutic, drug, ernst, chain, and, howard, florey, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, medicine, with, fleming, florey, credited, dubos, with, pioneering, the,

bacteria, were, unicellular, microorganism, that, were, the, first, form, of, life, to, appear, on, earth, about, billion, year, ago, for, about, billion, year, most, organism, were, microscopic, and, bacteria, and, archaea, were, the, dominant, form, of, life, in, fossil, of, macroorganisms, were, discovered, and, named, a, the, francevillian, biota, although, bacterial, fossil, exist, such, a, stromatolites, their, lack, of, distinctive, morphology, prevents, them, from, being, used, to, examine, the, history, of, bacterial, evolution, or, to, date, the, time, of, origin, of, a, particular, bacterial, specie, however, gene, sequence, can, be, used, to, reconstruct, the, bacterial, phylogeny, and, these, study, indicate, that, bacteria, diverged, first, from, the, lineage, bacteria, were, also, involved, in, the, second, great, evolutionary, divergence, that, of, the, archaea, and, eukaryote, here, eukaryote, resulted, from, the, entering, of, ancient, bacteria, into, endosymbiotic, association, with, the, ancestor, of, eukaryotic, cell, which, were, themselves, possibly, related, to, the, archaea, this, involved, the, engulfment, by, cell, of, alphaproteobacterial, symbionts, to, form, either, mitochondrion, or, hydrogenosomes, which, are, still, found, in, all, known, eukarya, sometimes, in, highly, reduced, form, in, ancient, amitochondrial, protozoa, later, on, some, eukaryote, that, already, contained, mitochondrion, also, engulfed, organism, this, led, to, the, formation, of, chloroplast, in, algae, and, plant, there, are, also, some, algae, that, originated, from, even, later, endosymbiotic, event, here, eukaryote, engulfed, a, eukaryotic, algae, that, developed, into, a, plastid, this, is, known, a, secondary, endosymbiosis, morphology, further,

from, polysaccharide, chain, by, peptide, containing, acid, bacterial, cell, wall, are, different, from, the, cell, wall, of, plant, and, fungi, which, are, made, of, cellulose, and, chitin, respectively, the, cell, wall, of, bacteria, is, also, distinct, from, that, of, archaea, which, do, not, contain, peptidoglycan, the, cell, wall, is, essential, to, the, survival, of, many, bacteria, and, the, antibiotic, penicillin, is, able, to, kill, bacteria, by, inhibiting, a, step, in, the, synthesis, of, peptidoglycan, there, are, broadly, speaking, two, different, type, of, cell, wall, in, bacteria, a, thick, one, in, the, and, a, thinner, one, in, the, the, name, originate, from, the, reaction, of, cell, to, the, gram, stain, a, test, for, the, classification, of, bacterial, specie, bacteria, posse, a, thick, cell, wall, containing, many, layer, of, peptidoglycan, and, teichoic, acid, in, contrast, bacteria, have, a, relatively, thin, cell, wall, consisting, of, a, few, layer, of, peptidoglycan, surrounded, by, a, second, lipid, membrane, containing, lipopolysaccharides, and, lipoprotein, lipopolysaccharides, also, called, endotoxin, are, composed, of, polysaccharide, and, lipid, a, that, is, responsible, for, much, of, the, toxicity, of, bacteria, most, bacteria, have, the, cell, wall, and, only, the, firmicutes, and, actinobacteria, have, the, alternative, arrangement, these, two, group, were, previously, known, a, the, low, and, high, bacteria, respectively, these, difference, in, structure, can, produce, difference, in, antibiotic, susceptibility, for, instance, vancomycin, can, kill, only, bacteria, and, is, ineffective, against, pathogen, such, a, haemophilus, influenzae, or, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, if, the, bacterial, cell, wall, is, entirely, removed, it, is, called, a, protoplast, whereas, if, it, is, partially, removed, it, is, called, a, spheroplast, antibiotic, such, a, penicillin, inhibit, the, formation, of, peptidoglycan, in, the, bacterial, cell, wall, the, enzyme, lysozyme, found, in, human, tear, also, digest, the, cell, wall, of, bacteria, and, is, the, body, main, defense, against, eye, infection, bacteria, such, a, mycobacteria, are, resistant, to, decolorization, by, acid, during, staining, procedure, the, high, mycolic, acid, content, of, mycobacteria, is, responsible, for, the, staining, pattern, of, poor, absorption, followed, by, high, retention, the, most, common, staining, technique, used, to, identify, bacteria, is, the, stain, or, stain, in, which, the, bacillus, are, stained, and, stand, out, clearly, against, a, blue, background, bacteria, are, strain, of, bacteria, that, lack, cell, wall, the, main, pathogenic, bacteria, in, this, class, is, mycoplasma, not, to, be, confused, with, mycobacteria, in, many, bacteria, an, of, rigidly, arrayed, protein, molecule, cover, the, outside, of, the, cell, this, layer, provides, chemical, and, physical, protection, for, the, cell, surface,

nanometre, in, diameter, and, up, to, micrometres, in, length, that, are, used, for, motility, flagellum, are, driven, by, the, energy, released, by, the, transfer, of, ion, down, an, electrochemical, gradient, across, the, cell, membrane, fimbria, sometimes, called, attachment, pili, are, fine, filament, of, protein, usually, nanometre, in, diameter, and, up, to, several, micrometer, in, length, they, are, distributed, over, the, surface, of, the, cell, and, resemble, fine, hair, when, seen, under, the, electron, microscope, fimbria, are, believed, to, be, involved, in, attachment, to, solid, surface, or, to, other, cell, and, are, essential, for, the, virulence, of, some, bacterial, pathogen, pili, sing, pilus, are, cellular, appendage, slightly, larger, than, fimbria, that, can, transfer, genetic, material, between, bacterial, cell, in, a, process, called, conjugation, where, they, are, called, conjugation, pili, or, sex, pili, see, bacterial, genetics, below, they, can, also, generate, movement, where, they, are, called, type, iv, pili, see, movement, below, glycocalyx, are, produced, by, many, bacteria, to, surround, their, cell, and, vary, in, structural, complexity, ranging, from, a, disorganised, slime, layer, of, polymer, to, a, highly, structured, capsule, these, structure, can, protect, cell, from, engulfment, by, eukaryotic, cell, such, a, macrophage, part, of, the, human, immune, system, they, can, also, act, a, antigen, and, be, involved, in, cell, recognition, a, well, a, aiding, attachment, to, surface, and, the, formation, of, biofilms, the, assembly, of, these, extracellular, structure, is, dependent, on, bacterial, secretion, system, these, transfer, protein, from, the, cytoplasm, into, the, periplasm, or, into, the, environment, around, the, cell, many, type, of, secretion, system, are, known, and, these, structure, are, often, essential, for, the, virulence, of, pathogen, so, are, intensively, studied,

in, addition, to, fixing, carbon, dioxide, in, photosynthesis, some, bacteria, also, fix, nitrogen, gas, nitrogen, fixation, using, the, enzyme, nitrogenase, this, environmentally, important, trait, can, be, found, in, bacteria, of, nearly, all, the, metabolic, type, listed, above, but, is, not, universal, regardless, of, the, type, of, metabolic, process, they, employ, the, majority, of, bacteria, are, able, to, take, in, raw, material, only, in, the, form, of, relatively, small, molecule, which, enter, the, cell, by, diffusion, or, through, molecular, channel, in, cell, membrane, the, planctomycetes, are, the, exception, a, they, are, in, possessing, membrane, around, their, nuclear, material, it, ha, recently, been, shown, that, gemmata, obscuriglobus, is, able, to, take, in, large, molecule, via, a, process, that, in, some, way, resembles, endocytosis, the, process, used, by, eukaryotic, cell, to, engulf, external, item, growth, and, reproduction, many, bacteria, reproduce, through, binary, fission, which, is, compared, to, mitosis, and, meiosis, in, this, image, further, information, bacterial, growth, unlike, in, multicellular, organism, increase, in, cell,

daughter, cell, example, include, fruiting, body, formation, by, myxobacteria, and, aerial, hypha, formation, by, streptomyces, or, budding, budding, involves, a, cell, forming, a, protrusion, that, break, away, and, produce, a, daughter, cell, a, colony, of, escherichia, coli, in, the, laboratory, bacteria, are, usually, grown, using, solid, or, liquid, medium, solid, growth, medium, such, a, agar, plate, are, used, to, isolate, pure, culture, of, a, bacterial, strain, however, liquid, growth, medium, are, used, when, measurement, of, growth, or, large, volume, of, cell, are, required, growth, in, stirred, liquid, medium, occurs, a, an, even, cell, suspension, making, the, culture, easy, to, divide, and, transfer, although, isolating, single, bacteria, from, liquid, medium, is, difficult, the, use, of, selective, medium, medium, with, specific, nutrient, added, or, deficient, or, with, antibiotic, added, can, help, identify, specific, organism, most, laboratory, technique, for, growing, bacteria, use, high, level, of, nutrient, to, produce, large, amount, of, cell, cheaply, and, quickly, however, in, natural, environment, nutrient, are, limited, meaning, that, bacteria, can, not, continue, to, reproduce, indefinitely, this, nutrient, limitation, ha, led, the, evolution, of, different, growth, strategy, see, selection, theory, some, organism, can, grow, extremely, rapidly, when, nutrient, become, available, such, a, the, formation, of, algal, and, cyanobacterial, bloom, that, often, occur, in, lake, during, the, summer, other, organism, have, adaptation, to, harsh, environment, such, a, the, production, of, multiple, antibiotic, by, streptomyces, that, inhibit, the, growth, of, competing, microorganism, in, nature, many, organism, live, in, community, biofilms, that, may, allow, for, increased, supply, of, nutrient, and, protection, from, environmental, stress, these, relationship, can, be, essential, for, growth, of, a, particular, organism, or, group, of, organism, syntrophy, bacterial, growth, follows, four, phase, when, a, population, of, bacteria, first, enter, a, environment, that, allows, growth, the, cell, need, to, adapt, to, their, new, environment, the, first, phase, of, growth, is, the, lag, phase, a, period, of, slow, growth, when, the, cell, are, adapting, to, the, environment, and, preparing, for, fast, growth, the, lag, phase, ha, high, biosynthesis, rate, a, protein, necessary, for, rapid, growth, are, produced, the, second, phase, of, growth, is, the, log, phase, also, known, a, the, logarithmic, or, exponential, phase, the, log, phase, is, marked, by, rapid, exponential, growth, the, rate, at, which, cell, grow, during, this, phase, is, known, a, the, growth, rate, k, and, the, time, it, take, the, cell, to, double, is, known, a, the, generation, time, g, during, log, phase, nutrient, are, metabolised, at, maximum, speed, until, one, of, the, nutrient, is, depleted, and, start, limiting, growth, the, third, phase, of, growth, is, the, stationary, phase, and, is, caused, by, depleted, nutrient, the, cell, reduce, their, metabolic, activity, and, consume, cellular, protein, the, stationary, phase, is, a, transition, from, rapid, growth, to, a, stress, response, state, and, there, is, increased, expression, of, gene, involved, in, dna, repair, antioxidant, metabolism, and, nutrient, transport, the, final, phase, is, the, death, phase, where, the, bacteria, run, out, of, nutrient, and, die, genetics, further, information, plasmid, genome, most, bacteria, have, a, single, circular, chromosome, that, can, range, in, size, from, only, base, pair, in, the, endosymbiotic, bacteria, candidatus, carsonella, ruddii, to, base, pair, in, the, bacteria, sorangium, cellulosum, spirochaete, of, the, genus, borrelia, are, a, notable, exception, to, this, arrangement, with, bacteria, such, a, borrelia, burgdorferi, the, cause, of, lyme, disease, containing, a, single, linear, chromosome, the, gene, in, bacterial, genome, are, usually, a, single, continuous, stretch, of, dna, and, although, several, different, type, of, intron, do, exist, in, bacteria, these, are, much, more, rare, than, in, eukaryote, bacteria, may, also, contain, plasmid, which, are, small, dna, that, may, contain, gene, for, antibiotic, resistance, or, virulence, factor, plasmid, replicate, independently, of, chromosome, so, it, is, possible, that, plasmid, could, be, lost, in, bacterial, cell, division, against, this, possibility, is, the, fact, that, a, single, bacterium, can, contain, hundred, of, copy, of, a, single, plasmid, bacteria, a, asexual, organism, inherit, identical, copy, of, their, parent, gene, they, are, clonal, however, all, bacteria, can, evolve, by, selection, on, change, to, their, genetic, material, dna, caused, by, genetic, recombination, or, mutation, mutation, come, from, error, made, during, the, replication, of, dna, or, from, exposure, to, mutagen, mutation, rate, vary, widely, among, different, specie, of, bacteria, and, even, among, different, clone, of, a, single, specie, of, bacteria, genetic, change, in, bacterial, genome, come, from, either, random, mutation, during, replication, or, mutation, where, gene, involved, in, a, particular, process, have, an, increased, mutation, rate, dna, transfer, some, bacteria, also, transfer, genetic, material, between, cell, this, can, occur, in, three, main, way, first, bacteria, can, take, up, exogenous, dna, from, their, environment, in, a, process, called, transformation, gene, can, also, be, transferred, by, the, process, of, transduction, when, the, integration, of, a, bacteriophage, introduces, foreign, dna, into, the, chromosome, the, third, method, of, gene, transfer, is, conjugation, whereby, dna, is, transferred, through, direct, cell, contact, transduction, of, bacterial, gene, by, bacteriophage, appears, to, be, a, consequence, of, infrequent, error, during, intracellular, assembly, of, virus, particle, rather, than, a, bacterial, adaptation, conjugation, in, the, coli, system, is, determined, by, plasmid, gene, and, is, an, adaptation, for, transferring, copy, of, the, plasmid, from, one, bacterial, host, to, another, it, is, seldom, that, a, conjugative, plasmid, integrates, into, the, host, bacterial, chromosome, and, subsequently, transfer, part, of, the, host, bacterial, dna, to, another, bacterium, transfer, of, host, bacterial, dna, also, appears, to, be, an, accidental, process, rather, than, a, bacterial, adaptation, transformation, unlike, transduction, or, conjugation, depends, on, numerous, bacterial, gene, product, that, specifically, interact, to, perform, this, complex, process, and, thus, transformation, is, clearly, a, bacterial, adaptation, for, dna, transfer, in, order, for, a, bacterium, to, bind, take, up, and, recombine, donor, dna, into, it, own, chromosome, it, must, first, enter, a, special, physiological, state, termed, competence, see, natural, competence, in, bacillus, subtilis, about, gene, are, required, for, the, development, of, competence, the, length, of, dna, transferred, during, subtilis, transformation, can, be, between, a, third, of, a, chromosome, up, to, the, whole, chromosome, transformation, appears, to, be, common, among, bacterial, specie, and, thus, far, at, least, specie, are, known, to, have, the, natural, ability, to, become, competent, for, transformation, the, development, of, competence, in, nature, is, usually, associated, with, stressful, environmental, condition, and, seems, to, be, an, adaptation, for, facilitating, repair, of, dna, damage, in, recipient, cell, in, ordinary, circumstance, transduction, conjugation, and, transformation, involve, transfer, of, dna, between, individual, bacteria, of, the, same, specie, but, occasionally, transfer, may, occur, between, individual, of, different, bacterial, specie, and, this, may, have, significant, consequence, such, a, the, transfer, of, antibiotic, resistance, in, such, case, gene, acquisition, from, other, bacteria, or, the, environment, is, called, horizontal, gene, transfer, and, may, be, common, under, natural, condition, gene, transfer, is, particularly, important, in, antibiotic, resistance, a, it, allows, the, rapid, transfer, of, resistance, gene, between, different, pathogen, bacteriophage, main, article, bacteriophage, bacteriophage, are, virus, that, infect, bacteria, many, type, of, bacteriophage, exist, some, simply, infect, and, lyse, their, host, bacteria, while, others, insert, into, the, bacterial, chromosome, a, bacteriophage, can, contain, gene, that, contribute, to, it, host, phenotype, for, example, in, the, evolution, of, escherichia, coli, and, clostridium, botulinum, the, toxin, gene, in, an, integrated, phage, converted, a, harmless, ancestral, bacterium, into, a, lethal, pathogen, bacteria, resist, phage, infection, through, restriction, modification, system, that, degrade, foreign, dna, and, a, system, that, us, crispr, sequence, to, retain, fragment, of, the, genome, of, phage, that, the, bacteria, have, come, into, contact, with, in, the, past, which, allows, them, to, block, virus, replication, through, a, form, of, rna, interference, this, crispr, system, provides, bacteria, with, acquired, immunity, to, infection, behavior, secretion, bacteria, frequently, secrete, chemical, into, their, environment, in, order, to, modify, it, favorably, the, secretion, are, often, protein, and, may, act, a, enzyme, that, digest, some, form, of, food, in, the, environment, bioluminescence, further, information, milky, sea, effect, a, few, bacteria, have, chemical, system, that, generate, light, this, bioluminescence, often, occurs, in, bacteria, that, live, in, association, with, fish, and, the, light, probably, serf, to, attract, fish, or, other, large, animal, multicellularity, see, also, prokaryote, sociality, bacteria, often, function, a,

multicellular, cooperation, include, a, cellular, division, of, labor, accessing, resource, that, can, not, effectively, be, utilized, by, single, cell, collectively, defending, against, antagonist, and, optimizing, population, survival, by, differentiating, into, distinct, cell, type, for, example, bacteria, in, biofilms, can, have, more, than, time, increased, resistance, to, antibacterial, agent, than, individual, planktonic, bacteria, of, the, same, specie, one, type, of, communication, by, a, molecular, signal, is, called, quorum, sensing, which, serf, the, purpose, of, determining, whether, there, is, a, local, population, density, that, is, sufficiently, high, that, it, is, productive, to, invest, in, process, that, are, only, successful, if, large, number, of, similar, organism, behave, similarly, a, in, excreting, digestive, enzyme, or, emitting, light, quorum, sensing, allows, bacteria, to, coordinate, gene, expression, and, enables, them, to, produce, release, and, detect, autoinducers, or, pheromone, which, accumulate, with, the, growth, in, cell, population, movement, further, information, chemotaxis, flagellum, pilus, many, bacteria, can, move, using, a,

them, in, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, of, bacteria, the, term, bacteria, wa, traditionally, applied, to, all, microscopic, prokaryote, however, molecular, systematics, showed, prokaryotic, life, to, consist, of, two, separate, domain, originally, called, eubacteria, and, archaebacteria, but, now, called, bacteria, and, archaea, that, evolved, independently, from, an, ancient, common, ancestor, the, archaea, and, eukaryote, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, the, bacteria, these, two, domain, along, with, eukarya, are, the, basis, of, the, system, which, is, currently, the, most, widely, used, classification, system, in, microbiolology, however, due, to, the, relatively, recent, introduction, of, molecular, systematics, and, a,

greater, incidence, of, the, disease, government, can, play, a, role, in, this, in, for, example, the, zimbabwean, cholera, outbreak, wa, due, partly, to, the, government, role, according, to, a, report, from, the, james, baker, institute, the, haitian, inability, to, provide, safe, drinking, water, after, the, earthquake, led, to, an, increase, in, cholera, case, a, well, similarly, south,

from, river, not, in, citation, given, according, to, rita, colwell, of, the, james, baker, institute, if, cholera, doe, begin, to, spread, government, preparedness, is, crucial, a, government, ability, to, contain, the, disease, before, it, extends, to, other, area, can, prevent, a, high, death, toll, and, the, development, of, an, epidemic, or, even, pandemic, effective, disease, surveillance, can, ensure, that, cholera, outbreak, are, recognized, a, soon, a, possible, and, dealt, with, appropriately, oftentimes, this, will, allow, public, health, program, to, determine, and, control, the, cause, of, the, case, whether, it, is, unsanitary, water, or, seafood, that, have, accumulated, a, lot, of, vibrio, cholerae, specimen, having, an, effective, surveillance, program, contributes, to, a, ability, to, prevent, cholera, from, spreading, in, the, year, in, the, state, of, kerala, in, india, the, kottayam, district, wa, determined, to, be, this, pronouncement, led, to, task, force, that, concentrated, on, educating, citizen, with, information, session, about, human, health, these, task, force, promoted, the, boiling, of, water, to, obtain, safe, water, and, provided, chlorine, and, oral, rehydration, salt, ultimately, this, helped, to, control, the, spread, of, the, disease, to, other, area, and, minimize, death, on, the, other, hand, researcher, have, shown, that, most, of, the, citizen, infected, during, the, cholera, outbreak, in, bangladesh, lived, in, rural, area, and, were, not, recognized, by, the, government, surveillance, program, this, inhibited, physician, ability, to, detect, cholera, case, early, according, to, colwell, the, quality, and, inclusiveness, of, a, country, health, care, system, affect, the, control, of, cholera, a, it, did, in, the, zimbabwean, cholera, outbreak, while, sanitation, practice, are, important, when, government, respond, quickly, and, have, readily, available, vaccine, the, country, will, have, a, lower, cholera, death, toll, affordability, of, vaccine, can, be, a, problem, if, the, government, do, not, provide, vaccination, only, the, wealthy, may, be, able, to, afford, them, and, there, will, be, a, greater, toll, on, the, country, poor, the, speed, with, which, government, leader, respond, to, cholera, outbreak, is, important, besides, contributing, to, an, effective, or, declining, public, health, care, system, and, water, sanitation, treatment, government, can, have, indirect, effect, on, cholera, control, and, the, effectiveness, of, a, response, to, cholera, a, country,

unambiguously, to, many, case, it, is, part, of, a, continuum, of, type, of, interaction, between, specie, rather, than, an, exclusive, category, in, many, case, it, is, difficult, to, demonstrate,

ectoparasite, parasite, that, live, on, the, outside, of, the, host, either, on, the, skin, or, the, outgrowth, of, the, skin, are, called, ectoparasite, louse, flea, and, some, mite, those, that, live, inside, the, host, are, called, endoparasite, including, all, parasitic, worm, endoparasite, can, exist, in, one, of, two, form, intercellular, parasite, inhabiting, space, in, the, body, or, intracellular, parasite, inhabiting, cell, in, the, body, intracellular, parasite, such, a, protozoa, bacteria, or, virus, tend, to, rely, on, a, third, organism, which, is, generally, known, a, the, carrier, or, vector, the, vector, doe, the, job, of, transmitting, them, to, the, host, an, example, of, this, interaction, is, the, transmission, of, malaria, caused, by, a, protozoan, of, the, genus, plasmodium, to, human, by, the, bite, of, an, anopheline, mosquito, those, parasite, living, in, an, intermediate, position, being, and, are, called, mesoparasites, schistosoma, mansoni, is, an, endoparasite, that, life, in, human, blood, vessel, an, epiparasite, is, one, that, feed, on, another, parasite, this, relationship, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, a, hyperparasitism, exemplified, by, a, protozoan, the, hyperparasite, living, in, the, digestive, tract, of, a, flea, living, on, a, dog, social, parasite, take, advantage, of, interaction, between, member, of, social, organism, such, a, ant, or, termite, an, example, is, phengaris, arion, a, butterfly, whose, larva, employ, mimicry, to, parasitize, certain, specie, of, ant, in, kleptoparasitism, from, the, greek, kleptes, thief, parasite, appropriate, food, gathered, by, the, host, an, example, is, the, brood, parasitism, practiced, by, cuckoo, and, cowbird, which, do, not, build, nest, of, their, own, and, leave, their, egg, in, nest, of, other, specie, the, host, behaves, a, a, babysitter, a, they, raise, the, young, a, their, own, if, the, host, remove, the, cuckoo, egg, some, cuckoo, will, return, and, attack, the, nest, to, compel, host, bird, to, remain, subject, to, this, parasitism, intraspecific, social, parasitism, may, also, occur, one, example, of, this, is, parasitic, nursing, where, some, individual, take, milk, from, unrelated, female, in, capuchin, higher, ranking, female, sometimes, take, milk, from, low, ranking, female, without, any, reciprocation, the, high, ranking, female, benefit, at, the, expense, of, the, low, ranking, female, parasitism, can, take, the, form, of, isolated, cheating, or, exploitation, among, more, generalized, mutualistic, interaction, for, example, broad, class, of, plant, and, fungi, exchange, carbon, and, nutrient, in, common, mutualistic, mycorrhizal, relationship, however, some, plant, specie, known, a, cheat, by, taking, carbon, from, a, fungus, rather, than, donating, it, an, from, the, greek, adelphos, brother, is, a, parasite, in, which, the, host, specie, is, closely, related, to, the, parasite, often, being, a, member, of, the, same, family, or, genus, an, example, of, this, is, the, citrus, blackfly, parasitoid, encarsia, perplexa, unmated, female, of, which, may, lay, haploid, egg, in, the, fully, developed, larva, of, their, own, specie, these, result, in, the, production, of, male, offspring, the, marine, worm, bonellia, viridis, ha, a, similar, reproductive, strategy, although, the, larva, are, planktonic, autoinfection, is, the, infection, of, a, primary, host, with, a, parasite, particularly, a, helminth, in, such, a, way, that, the, complete, life, cycle, of, the, parasite, happens, in, a, single, organism, without, the, involvement, of, another, host, therefore, the, primary, host, is, at, the, same, time, the, secondary, host, of, the, parasite, some, of, the, organism, where, autoinfection, occurs, are, strongyloides, stercoralis, enterobius, vermicularis, taenia, solium, and, hymenolepis, nana, strongyloidiasis, for, example, involves, premature, transformation, of, noninfective, larva, in, infective, larva, which, can, then, penetrate, the, intestinal, mucosa, internal, autoinfection, or, the, skin, of, the, perineal, area, external, autoinfection, infection, can, be, maintained, by, repeated, migratory, cycle, for, the, remainder, of, the, person, life, host, defense, edit, animal, defense, edit, skin, edit, the, first, line, of, defense, against, invading, parasite, is, the, skin, skin, is, made, up, layer, of, dead, cell, and, act, a, a, physical, barrier, to, invading, organism, these, dead, cell, contain, the, protein, keratin, which, make, skin, tough, and, waterproof, most, microorganism, need, a, moist, environment, to, survive, by, keeping, the, skin, dry, it, prevents, invading, organism, from, colonizing, furthermore, human, skin, also, secretes, sebum, which, is, toxic, to, most, microorganism, mouth, edit, the, mouth, contains, saliva, which, prevents, foreign, organism, from, getting, into, the, body, orally, furthermore, the, mouth, also, contains, lysozyme, an, enzyme, found, in, tear, and, the, saliva, this, enzyme, break, down, cell, wall, of, invading, microorganism, stomach, edit, should, the, organism, pas, the, mouth, the, stomach, is, the, next, line, of, defense, the, stomach, contains, hydrochloric, acid, and, gastric, acid, which, make, it, ph, level, around, in, this, environment, the, acidity, of, the, stomach, help, kill, most, microorganism, that, try, to, invade, the, body, through, the, gastric, intestinal, tract, eye, edit, parasite, can, also, invade, the, body, through, the, eye, the, lash, on, the, eyelid, prevents, invading, microorganism, from, entering, the, eye, in, the, first, place, even, if, the, microorganism, do, get, into, the, eye, tear, contain, the, enzyme, lysozyme, which, will, kill, most, invading, microorganism, immune, system, edit, should, the, parasite, enter, the, body, the, immune, system, is, a, major, defense, against, parasitic, invasion, the, immune, system, is, made, up, of, different, family, of, molecule, these, include, serum, protein, and, pattern, recognition, receptor, prrs, prrs, are, intracellular, and, cellular, receptor, that, activate, dendritic, cell, which, in, turn, activate, the, adaptive, immune, lymphocyte, lymphocyte, such, a, the, t, cell, and, antibody, producing, b, cell, with, variable, receptor, that, recognize, parasite, insect, defense, edit, insect, often, adapt, their, nest, to, aid, in, parasite, defense, for, example, one, of, the, key, reason, the, polistes, canadensis, nest, across, multiple, comb, rather, than, building, a, single, comb, like, much, of, the, rest, of, it, genus, is, a, a, defense, mechanism, against, the, infestation, of, tineid, moth, the, tineid, moth, lay, it, egg, within, the, wasp, nest, and, then, these, egg, hatch, into, larva, that, can, burrow, from, cell, to, cell, and, prey, on, wasp, pupa, adult, wasp, attempt, to, remove, and, kill, moth, egg, and, larva, by, chewing, down, the, edge, of, cell, coating, the, cell, with, an, oral, secretion, that, give, the, nest, a, dark, brownish, appearance, plant, defense, edit, in, response, to, parasitic, attack, plant, undergo, a, series, of, metabolic, and, biochemical, reaction, pathway, that, will, enact, defensive, response, for, example, parasitic, invasion, cause, an, increase, in, the, jasmonic, ja, and, nahg, sa, pathway, these, pathway, produce, chemical, that, will, induce, defensive, response, such, a, the, production, of, chemical, or, defensive, molecule, to, fight, off, the, attack, different, biochemical, pathway, are, activated, by, different, parasite, in, general, there, are, two, type, of, response, that, can, be, activated, by, the, pathway, plant, can, either, initiate, a, specific, or, response, specific, response, involve, recognition, of, the, plant, and, parasite, this, can, be, mediated, by, the, ability, of, the, cell, receptor, recognizing, and, binding, molecule, that, are, located, on, the, cell, surface, of, parasite, once, the, receptor, recognizes, the, parasite, the, plant, localizes, the, defensive, compound, to, that, area, creating, a, hypersensitive, response, this, form, of, defense, mechanism, localizes, the, area, of, attack, and, keep, the, parasite, from, spreading, furthermore, a, specific, response, against, parasitic, attack, prevents, the, plant, from, wasting, it, energy, by, increasing, defense, where, not, need, however, specific, defensive, response, only, target, specific, parasite, if, the, plant, lack, the, ability, to, recognize, a, parasite, specific, defense, response, be, activated, nonspecific, defensive, response, work, against, all, parasite, these, response, are, active, over, time, and, are, systematic, meaning, that, the, response, are, not, confined, to, an, area, of, the, plant, but, rather, spread, throughout, the, entirety, of, the, organism, however, nonspecific, response, are, energy, costly, since, the, plant, ha, to, ensure, that, the, gene, producing, the, nonspecific, response, are, always, expressed, evolutionary, aspect, edit, parasitism, ha, arisen, independently, many, time, depending, on, the, definition, used, a, many, a, half, of, all, animal, have, at, least, one, parasitic, phase, in, their, life, cycle, and, is, frequent, in, plant, and, fungi, almost, all, animal, are, host, to, one, or, more, parasitic, taxon, restoration, of, a, tyrannosaurus, with, parasite, infection, a, study, showed, that, hole, in, the, skull, of, several, specimen, might, have, been, caused, by, parasite, parasite, evolve, in, response, to, their, host, defence, sometimes, in, a, manner, specific, to, a, particular, host, taxon, and, specializing, to, the, point, where, they, infect, only, a, single, specie, such, narrow, host, specificity, can, be, costly, over, evolutionary, time, however, if, the, host, specie, becomes, extinct, therefore, many, parasite, can, infect, a, variety, of, more, or, le, closely, related, host, specie, with, different, success, rate, citation, needed, in, turn, host, defense, coevolve, in, response, to, attack, by, parasite, theoretically, parasite, may, have, an, advantage, in, this, evolutionary, arm, race, because, their, generation, time, commonly, is, shorter, host, reproduce, le, quickly, than, parasite, and, therefore, have, fewer, chance, to, adapt, than, their, parasite, do, over, a, given, span, of, time, coevolution, sometimes, lead, to, a, relatively, stable, relationship, tending, to, commensalism, or, mutualism, a, all, else, being, equal, it, is, in, the, evolutionary, interest, of, the, parasite, that, it, host, thrives, a, parasite, may, evolve, to, become, le, harmful, for, it, host, or, a, host, may, evolve, to, cope, with, the, unavoidable, presence, of, a, the, point, that, the, parasite, absence, cause, the, host, harm, for, example, although, animal, infected, with, parasitic, worm, are, often, clearly, harmed, and, therefore, parasitized, such, infection, may, also, reduce, the, prevalence, and, effect, of, autoimmune, disorder, in, animal, host, including, human, in, a, more, extreme, example, some, nematode, worm, can, not, reproduce, or, even, survive, without, infection, by, wolbachia, bacteria, competition, between, parasite, tends, to, favor, faster, reproducing, and, therefore, more, virulent, parasite, citation, needed, parasite, whose, life, cycle, involves, the, death, of, the, host, to, exit, the, present, host, and, sometimes, to, enter, the, next, evolve, to, be, more, virulent, or, even, alter, the, behavior, or, other, property, of, the, host, to, make, it, more, vulnerable, to, predator, parasite, that, reproduce, largely, to, the, offspring, of, the, previous, host, tend, to, become, le, virulent, or, mutualist, so, that, it, host, reproduce, more, effectively, the, presumption, of, a, shared, evolutionary, history, between, parasite, and, host, can, sometimes, elucidate, how, host, taxon, are, related, for, instance, there, ha, been, dispute, about, whether, flamingo, are, more, closely, related, to, the, stork, and, their, relative, or, to, duck, goose, and, their, relative, the, fact, that, flamingo, share, parasite, with, duck, and, goose, is, evidence, these, group, may, be, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, stork, parasitism, is, part, of, one, explanation, for, the, evolution, of, secondary, sex, characteristic, seen, in, breeding, male, throughout, the, animal, world, such, a, the, plumage, of, male, peacock, and, mane, of, male, lion, according, to, this, theory, female, host, select, male, for, breeding, based, on, such, characteristic, because, they, indicate, resistance, to, parasite, and, other, disease, edit, in, rare, case, a, parasite, may, even, undergo, with, it, host, one, particularly, remarkable, example, of, exists, between, the, simian, foamy, virus, sfv, and, it, primate, host, in, one, study, the, phylogeny, of, sfv, polymerase, and, the, mitochondrial, cytochrome, oxidase, subunit, ii, from, african, and, asian, primate, were, compared, surprisingly, the, phylogenetic, tree, were, very, congruent, in, branching, order, and, divergence, time, thus, the, simian, foamy, virus, may, have, with, old, world, primate, for, at, least, million, year, ecology, edit, quantitative, ecology, edit, a, single, parasite, specie, usually, ha, an, aggregated, distribution, across, host, individual, which, mean, that, most, host, harbor, few, parasite, while, a, few, host, carry, the, vast, majority, of, parasite, individual, this, pose, considerable, problem, for, student, of, parasite, ecology, the, use, of, parametric, statistic, should, be, avoided, citation, needed, of, data, before, the, application, of, parametric, test, or, the, use, of, statistic, is, recommended, by, several, author, however, this, can, give, rise, to, further, problem, therefore, modern, day, quantitative, parasitology, is, based, on, more, advanced, biostatistical, method, diversity, ecology, edit, host, represent, discrete, habitat, patch, that, can, be, occupied, by, parasite, a, hierarchical, set, of, terminology, ha, come, into, use, to, describe, parasite, assemblage, at, different, host, scale, infrapopulation, all, the, parasite, of, one, specie, in, a, single, individual, host, metapopulation, all, the, parasite, of, one, specie, in, a, host, population, infracommunity, all, the, parasite, of, all, specie, in, a, single, individual, host, component, community, all, the, parasite, of, all, specie, in, a, host, population, compound, community, all, the, parasite, of, all, specie, in, all, host, specie, in, an, ecosystem, the, diversity, ecology, of, parasite, differs, markedly, from, that, of, organism, for, organism, diversity, ecology, feature, many, strong, conceptual, framework, including, robert, macarthur, and, wilson, theory, of, island, biogeography, jared, diamond, assembly, rule, and, more, recently, null, model, such, a, stephen, hubbell, unified, neutral, theory, of, biodiversity, and, biogeography, framework, are, not, so, for, parasite, and, in, many, way, they, do, not, fit, the, model, for, example, island, biogeography, is, predicated, on, fixed, spatial, relationship, between, habitat, patch, sink, usually, with, reference, to, a, mainland, source, parasite, inhabit, host, which, represent, mobile, habitat, patch, with, dynamic, spatial, relationship, there, is, no, true, mainland, other, than, the, sum, of, host, host, population, so, parasite, component, community, in, host, population, are, metacommunities, nonetheless, different, type, of, parasite, assemblage, have, been, recognized, in, host, individual, and, population, and, many, of, the, pattern, observed, for, organism, are, also, pervasive, among, parasite, assemblage, the, most, prominent, of, these, is, the, continuum, this, proposes, that, parasite, assemblage, occur, along, a, cline, from, interactive, community, where, niche, are, saturated, and, interspecific, competition, is, high, to, isolationist, community, where, there, are, many, vacant, niche, and, interspecific, interaction, is, not, a, important, a, stochastic, factor, in, providing, structure, to, the, community, whether, this, is, so,

infective, to, allopatric, from, different, geographical, region, host, citation, needed, experiment, published, in, discus, the, analysis, of, two, different, snail, population, from, two, different, lake, ianthe, and, lake, poerua, in, new, zealand, the, population, were, exposed, to, two, pure, parasite, digenetic, trematode, taken, from, the, same, lake, in, the, experiment, the, snail, were, infected, by, their, sympatric, parasite, allopatric, parasite, and, mixed, source, of, parasite, the, result, suggest, that, the, parasite, were, more, highly, effective, in, infecting, their,

referred, to, a, parasite, transmission, or, colonization, some, endoparasite, infect, their, host, by, penetrating, it, external, surface, while, others, must, be, ingested, once, inside, the, host, adult, endoparasite, need, to, shed, offspring, into, the, external, environment, to, infect, other, host, many, adult, endoparasite, reside, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, where, offspring, can, be, shed, along, with, host, excreta, adult, stage, of, tapeworm, worm, and, most, fluke, use, this, method, among, protozoan, endoparasite, such, a, the, malarial, parasite, and, trypanosomes, infective, stage, in, the, blood, are, transported, to, new, host, by, or, vector, larval, stage, of, endoparasite, often, infect, site, in, the, host, other, than, the, blood, or, gastrointestinal, tract, in, many, such, case, larval, endoparasite, require, their, host, to, be, consumed, by, the, next, host, in, the, life, cycle, in, order, to, survive, and, reproduce, alternatively, larval, endoparasite, may, shed, transmission, stage, that, migrate, through, the, tissue, into, the, external, environment, where, they, actively, search, for, or, await, ingestion, by, other, host, the, foregoing, strategy, are, used, variously, by, larval, stage, of, tapeworm, worm, fluke, and, parasitic, roundworm, some, ectoparasite, such, a, monogenean, worm, rely, on, direct, contact, between,

some, aquatic, leech, locate, host, by, sensing, movement, and, only, attach, when, certain, temperature, and, chemical, cue, are, present, some, parasite, modify, host, behavior, in, order, to, increase, the, transmission, between, host, often, in, relation, to, predator, and, prey, parasite, increased, trophic, transmission, for, example, in, california, salt, marsh, the, fluke, euhaplorchis, californiensis, reduces, the, ability, of, it, killifish, host, to, avoid, predator, this, parasite, matures, in, egret, which, are, more, likely, to, feed, on, infected, killifish, than, on, uninfected, fish, another, example, is, the, protozoan, toxoplasma, gondii, a, parasite, that, matures, in, cat, but, can, be, carried, by, many, other, mammal, uninfected, rat, avoid, cat, odor, but, rat, infected, with, gondii, are, drawn, to, this, scent, which, may, increase, transmission, to, feline, host, role, in, ecosystem, edit, modifying, the, behavior, of, infected, host, to,

discussed, above, it, is, plausible, that, the, local, predator, and, prey, specie, might, be, different, if, this, parasite, were, absent, from, the, system, although, parasite, are, often, omitted, in, depiction, of, food, web, they, usually, occupy, the, top, position, parasite, can, function, like, keystone, specie, reducing, the, dominance, of, superior, competitor, and, allowing, competing, specie, to, many, parasite, require, multiple, host, of, the, different, specie, to, complete, their, life, cycle, and, rely, on, or, other, stable, ecological, interaction, to, get, from, one, host,

ophiostoma, causing, dutch, elm, disease, and, cryphonectria, parasitica, responsible, for, chestnut, blight, and, plant, pathogen, in, the, genus, fusarium, ustilago, alternaria, and, cochliobolus, some, carnivorous, fungi, like, paecilomyces, lilacinus, are, predator, of, nematode, which, they, capture, using, an, array, of, specialized, structure, such, a, constricting, ring, or, adhesive, net, some, fungi, can, cause, serious, disease, in, human, several, of, which, may, be, fatal, if, untreated, these, include, aspergillosis, candidoses, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and, paracoccidioidomycosis, furthermore, person, with, are, particularly, susceptible, to, disease, by, genus, such, a, aspergillus, candida, cryptoccocus, histoplasma, and, pneumocystis, other, fungi, can, attack, eye, nail, hair, and, especially, skin, the, dermatophytic, and, keratinophilic, fungi, and, cause, local, infection, such, a, ringworm, and, athlete, foot, fungal, spore, are, also, a, cause, of, allergy, and, fungi, from, different, taxonomic, group, can, evoke, allergic, reaction, mycotoxin, ergotamine, a, major, mycotoxin, produced, by, claviceps, specie, which, if, ingested, can, cause, gangrene, convulsion, and, hallucination, mycotoxin, are, secondary, metabolite, or, natural, product, and, research, ha, established, the, existence, of, biochemical, pathway, solely, for, the, purpose, of, producing, mycotoxin, and, other, natural, product, in, fungi, mycotoxin, may, provide, fitness, benefit, in, term, of, physiological, adaptation, competition, with, other, microbe, and, fungi, and, protection, from, consumption, fungivory, many, fungi, produce, biologically, active, compound, several, of, which, are, toxic, to, animal, or, plant, and, are, therefore, called, mycotoxin, of, particular, relevance, to, human, are, mycotoxin, produced, by, mold, causing, food, spoilage, and, poisonous, mushroom, see, above, particularly, infamous, are, the, lethal, amatoxins, in, some, amanita, mushroom, and, ergot, alkaloid, which, have, a, long, history, of, causing, serious, epidemic, of, ergotism, st, anthony, fire, in, people, consuming, rye, or, related, cereal, contaminated, with, sclerotium, of, the, ergot, fungus, claviceps, purpurea, other, notable, mycotoxin, include, the, aflatoxin, which, are, insidious, liver, toxin, and, highly, carcinogenic, metabolite, produced, by, certain, aspergillus, specie, often, growing, in, or, on, grain, and, nut, consumed, by, human, ochratoxins, patulin, and, trichothecenes, mycotoxin, and, fumonisins, which, have, significant, impact, on, human, food, supply, or, animal, livestock, pathogenic, mechanism, ustilago, maydis, is, a, pathogenic, plant, fungus, that, cause, smut, disease, in, maize, and, teosinte, plant, have, evolved, efficient, defense, system, against, pathogenic, microbe, such, a, maydis, a, rapid, defense, reaction, after, pathogen, attack, is, the, oxidative, burst, where, the, plant, produce, reactive, oxygen, specie, at, the, site, of, the, attempted, invasion, maydis, can, respond, to, the, oxidative, burst, with, an, oxidative, stress, response, regulated, by, the, gene, the, response, protects, maydis, from, the, host, defense, and, is, necessary, for, the, virulence, furthermore, maydis, ha, a, recombinational, dna, repair, system, which, act, during, mitosis, and, meiosis, the, system, may, assist, the, pathogen, in, surviving, dna, damage, arising, from, the, host, oxidative, defensive, response, to, infection, cryptococcus, neoformans, is, an, encapsulated, yeast, that, can, live, in, both, plant, and, animal, neoformans, usually, infects, the, lung, where, it, is, phagocytosed, by, alveolar, macrophage, some, neoformans, can, survive, inside, macrophage, which, appears, to, be, the, basis, for, latency, disseminated, disease, and, resistance, to, antifungal, agent, one, mechanism, by, which, neoformans, survives, the, hostile, macrophage, environment, is, by, the, expression, of, gene, involved, in, the, oxidative, stress, response, another, mechanism, involves, meiosis, the, majority, of, neoformans, are, mating, type, a, filament, of, mating, type, an, ordinarily, have, haploid, nucleus, but, they, can, become, diploid, perhaps, by, endoduplication, or, by, stimulated, nuclear, fusion, to, form, blastospores, the, diploid, nucleus, of, blastospores, can, undergo, meiosis, including, recombination, to, form, haploid, basidiospore, that, can, be, dispersed, this, process, is, referred, to, a, monokaryotic, fruiting, this, process, requires, a, gene, called, which, is, a, conserved, homologue, of, gene, reca, in, bacteria, and, in, eukaryote, that, mediates, homologous, chromosome, pairing, during, meiosis, and, repair, of, dna, break, thus, neoformans, can, undergo, a, meiosis, monokaryotic, fruiting, that, promotes, recombinational, repair, in, the, oxidative, dna, damaging, environment, of, the, host, macrophage, and, the, repair, capability, may, contribute, to, it, virulence, human, use, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, cell, shown, with, dic,

criterion, known, a, koch, postulate, for, demonstrating, in, a, scientifically, sound, manner, that, a, disease, is, caused, by, a, particular, organism, these, postulate, grew, out, of, his, seminal, work, with, anthrax, using, purified, culture, of, the, pathogen, that, had, been, isolated, from, diseased, animal, koch, postulate, were, developed, in, the, century, a, general, guideline,

the, cause, of, disease, despite, their, not, fulfilling, all, of, koch, postulate, therefore, while, koch, postulate, retain, historical, importance, and, continue, to, inform, the, approach, to, microbiologic, diagnosis, fulfillment, of, all, four, postulate, is, not, required, to, demonstrate, causality, koch, postulate, have, also, influenced, scientist, who, examine, microbial,

reisolated, from, the, inoculated, diseased, experimental, host, and, identified, a, being, identical, to, the, original, specific, causative, agent, however, koch, abandoned, the, universalist, requirement, of, the, first, postulate, altogether, when, he, discovered, asymptomatic, carrier, of, cholera, and, later, of, typhoid, fever, asymptomatic, or, subclinical, infection, carrier, are, now, known, to, be, a, common, feature, of, many, infectious, disease, especially, virus, such, a, polio, herpes, simplex, hiv, and, hepatitis, a, a, specific, example, all, doctor, and, virologist,

bacteria, protozoa, and, helminth, and, can, in, extreme, case, survive, for, several, year, in, soil, therefore, the, presence, or, absence, of, viable, helminth, egg, viable, helminth, egg, mean, that, a, larva, would, be, able, to, hatch, from, the, egg, in, a, sample, of, dried, faecal, matter, compost, or, faecal, sludge, is, often, used, a, an, indicator, to, ass, the, efficiency, of,

helminth, egg, in, treatment, process, a, they, are, very, common, in, many, part, of, the, world, and, relatively, easy, to, identify, under, the, microscope, however, the, exact, inactivation,

matter, on, agricultural, soil, the, egg, are, the, infective, stage, of, the, life, cycle, for, causing, the, disease, helminthiasis, the, detection, of, viable, helminth, egg, in, sample, of, wastewater, sludge, or, fresh, feces, a, a, diagnostic, tool, for, the, infection, helminthiasis, is, not, straight, forward, and, many, laboratory, in, developing, country, lack, the, right, equipment, or, the, skilled, staff, required, to, do, so, most, of, the, complication, in, standard, protocol, for, looking, for, ascaris, egg, in, sample, from, various, sanitation, system, are, due, to, finding, one, egg, in, a, large, amount, of, water, or, soil, but, ascaris, egg, in, the, feces, of, infected, person, when, collected, in, dry, toilet, are, already, concentrated, and, they, do, not, get, diluted, by, water, each, adult, female, ascaris, produce, egg, per, day, therefore, the, technique, to, concentrate, the, egg, may, be, le, important, if, the, local, laboratory, is, not, equipped, to, do, them, and, simple, search, in, sample, from, sanitation, system, with, dry, toilet, from, the, faeces, vault, of, a, dry, toilet, uddt, could, be, done, quite, simply, and, if, none,

excreta, are, used, a, fertilizer, therefore, the, risk, of, using, contaminated, wastewater, and, sludge, in, agricultural, field, is, a, real, problem, especially, in, poor, country, where, this, practice, is, prevalent, in, soil, fresh, water, and, sewage, helminth, egg, remain, viable, for, many, month, in, faeces, night, soil, and, sludge, they, can, even, remain, for, several, year, this, is, due, to, the, composition, of, the, egg, shell, in, order, to, remove, helminth, egg, from, wastewater, process, that, remove, particle, such, a, sedimentation, filtration, or, are, employed, actually, in, contrast, to, the, bacteria, fecal, coliforms, helminth, ovum, can, not, be, inactivated, with, chlorine, uv, light, or, ozone, in, the, latter, case, at, least, not, with, economical, dos, because, ozone, are, needed, with, hour, contact, time, they, are, considered, highly, resistant, biological, structure, detail, about, the, contact, time, under, these, condition, and, other, related, environmental, factor, are, generally, not, for, every, type, of, helminth, egg, specie, the, best, way, to, inactivate, the, egg, is, to, raise, the, temperature, above, and, to, reduce, moisture, below, best, result, can, be, obtained, when, both, of, these, condition, are, combined, for, an, extended, period, of, time, these, condition, are, not, readily, achieved, during, wastewater, treatment, thus, helminth, egg, can, be, subsequently, inactivated, in, sludge, inactivation, in, sludge, treatment, process, edit, inactivation, of, helminth, ovum, can, be, achieved, in,

and, abdominal, distension, with, ascites, larval, invasion, of, the, skin, mostly, in, the, america, can, produce, a, skin, disease, called, cutaneous, larva, migrans, also, known, a, creeping, eruption, the, host, of, these, worm, are, not, human, and, the, larva, can, only, penetrate, the, upper, five, layer, of, the, skin, where, they, give, rise, to, intense, local, itching, usually, on, the, foot, or, lower, leg, known, a, ground, itch, this, infection, is, due, to, larva, from, the, braziliense, hookworm, the, larva, migrate, in, tortuous, tunnel, between, the, stratum, basale, and, stratum, corneum, of, the, skin, causing, serpiginous, vesicular, lesion, with, advancing, movement, of, the, larva, the, rear, portion, of, the, lesion, become, dry, and, crusty, the, lesion, are,

centimeter, by, millimeter, the, female, are, often, longer, and, stouter, additionally, male, can, be, distinguished, from, female, based, on, the, presence, of, a, prominent, posterior, copulatory, bursa, americanus, is, very, similar, in, morphology, to, duodenale, americanus, is, generally, smaller, than, duodenale, with, male, usually, to, mm, long, and, female, about, cm, long, whereas, duodenale, posse, two, pair, of, teeth, americanus, posse, a, pair, of, cutting, plate, in, the, buccal, capsule, additionally, the, hook, shape, is, much, more, defined, in, necator, than, in, ancylostoma, pathology, edit, hookworm, infection, is, generally, considered, to, be, asymptomatic, but, a, norman, stoll, described, in, hookworm, infection, is, an, extremely, dangerous, infection, because, it, damage, is, and, there, are, general, symptom, that, an, individual, may, experience, soon, after, infection, which, is, an, allergic, reaction, at, the, site, of, parasitic, penetration, and, entry, is, common, in, patient, infected, with, n, americanus, additionally, cough, and, pneumonitis, may, result, a, the, larva, begin, to, break, into, the, alveolus, and, travel, up, the, trachea, then, once, the, larva, reach, the, small, intestine, of, the, host, and, begin, to, mature, the, infected, individual, will, suffer, from, diarrhea, and, other, gastrointestinal, discomfort, however, the, and, symptom, referred, to, by, stoll, are, related, to, chronic, hookworm, infection, major, morbidity, associated, with, hookworm, infection, is, caused, by, intestinal, blood, loss, iron, deficiency, anemia, and, protein, malnutrition, they, result, mainly, from, adult, hookworm, in, the, small, intestine, ingesting, blood, rupturing, erythrocyte, and, degrading, hemoglobin, in, the, host, this, blood, loss, can, manifest, itself, physically, through, facial, and, peripheral, edema, eosinophilia, and, pica, caused, by, iron, deficiency, anemia, are, also, experienced, by, some, patient, recently, more, attention, ha, been, given, to, other, important, outcome, of, hookworm, infection, that, play, a, large, role, in, public, health, it, is, now, widely, accepted, that, child, who, suffer, from, chronic, hookworm, infection, can, suffer, from, growth, retardation, a, well, a, intellectual, and, cognitive, impairment, additionally, recent, research, ha, focused, on, the, potential, of, adverse, outcome, when, the, mother, is, infected, with, hookworm, during, pregnancy, the, disease, wa, linked, to, nematode, worm, ankylostoma, duodenalis, from, to, half, an, inch, long, in, the, intestine, chiefly, through, the, labour, of, theodor, bilharz, and, griesinger, in, egypt, the, symptom, can, be, linked, to, inflammation, in, the, gut, stimulated, by, feeding, hookworm, such, a, nausea, abdominal, pain, and, intermittent, diarrhea, and, to, progressive, anemia, in, prolonged, disease, capricious, appetite, pica, or, obstinate, constipation, followed, by, diarrhea, palpitation, thready, pulse, coldness, of, the, skin, pallor, of, the, mucous, membrane, fatigue, and, weakness, shortness, of, breath, and, in, case, running, a, fatal, course, dysentery, hemorrhage, and, edema, blood, test, in, early, infection, often, show, a, rise, in, number, of, eosinophil, a, type, of, white, blood, cell, that, is, preferentially, stimulated, by, worm, infection, in, tissue, large, number, of, eosinophil, are, also, present, in, the, local, inflammatory, response, falling, blood, hemoglobin, level, will, be, seen, in, case, of, prolonged, infection, with, anemia, in, contrast, to, most, intestinal, helminthiases, where, the, heaviest, parasitic, load, tend, to, occur, in, child, hookworm, prevalence, and, intensity, can, be, higher, among, adult, male, the, explanation, for, this, is, that, hookworm, infection, tends, to, be, occupational, so, that, coworkers, and, other, close, group, maintain, a, high, prevalence, of, infection, among, themselves, by, contaminating, their, work, environment, however, in, most, endemic, area, adult, woman, are, the, most, severely, affected, by, anemia, mainly, because, they, have, much, higher, physiological, need, for, iron, menstruation, repeated, pregnancy, an, interesting, consequence, of, this, in, the, case, of, ancylostoma, duodenale, infection, is, translactational, transmission, of, infection, the, larva, of, this, specie, do, not, all, immediately, pas, through, the, lung, and, on, into, the, gut, but, spread, around, the, body, via, the, circulation, to, become, dormant, inside, muscle, fiber, in, a, pregnant, woman, after, childbirth, some, or, all, of, these, larva, are, stimulated, to, the, circulation, presumably, by, sudden, hormonal, change, then, to, pas, into, the, mammary, gland, so, that, the, newborn, baby, can, receive, a, large, dose, of, infective, larva, through, it, mother, milk, this, account, for, otherwise, inexplicable, case, of, very, heavy, even, fatal, hookworm, infection, in, child, a, month, or, so, of, age, in, place, such, a, china, india, and, northern, australia, an, identical, phenomenon, is, much, more, commonly, seen, with, ancylostoma, caninum, infection, in, dog, where, the, newborn, pup, can, even, die, of, hemorrhaging, from, their, intestine, caused, by, massive, number, of, feeding, hookworm, this, also, reflects, the, close, evolutionary, link, between, the, human, and, canine, parasite, which, probably, have, a, common, ancestor, dating, back, to, when, human, and, dog, first, started, living, closely, together, filariform, larva, is, the, infective, stage, of, the, parasite, infection, occurs, when, larva, in, soil, prentrate, the, skin, or, when, they, are, ingested, through, contaminated, food, and, water, following, skin, penetration, larva, life, cycle, edit, hookworm, life, cycle, see, the, image, for, the, biological, life, cycle, of, the, hookworm, where, it, thrives, in, warm, earth, where, temperature, are, over, they, exist, primarily, in, sandy, or, loamy, soil, and, can, not, live, in, clay, or, muck, rainfall, average, must, be, more, than, mm, inch, a, year, for, them, to, survive, only, if, these, condition, exist, can, the, egg, hatch, infective, larva, of, necator, americanus, can, survive, at, higher, temperature, whereas, those, of, ancylostoma, duodenale, are, better, adapted, to, cooler, climate, generally, they, live, for, only, a, few, week, at, most, under, natural, condition, and, die, almost, immediately, on, exposure, to, direct, sunlight, or, desiccation, infection, of, the, host, is, by, the, larva, not, the, egg, while, duodenale, can, be, ingested, the, usual, method, of, infection, is, through, the, skin, this, is, commonly, caused, by, walking, barefoot, through, area, contaminated, with, fecal, matter, the, larva, are, able, to, penetrate, the, skin, of, the, foot, and, once, inside, the, body, they, migrate, through, the, vascular, system, to, the, lung, and, from, there, up, the, trachea, and, are, swallowed, they, then, pas, down, the, esophagus, and, enter, the, digestive, system, finishing, their, journey, in, the, intestine, where, the, larva, mature, into, adult, worm, once, in, the, host, gut, necator, tends, to, cause, a, prolonged, infection, generally, year, many, die, within, a, year, or, two, of, infecting, though, some, adult, worm, have, been, recorded, to, live, for, year, or, more, on, the, other, hand, ancylostoma, adult, are, short, lived, surviving, on, average, for, only, about, month, however, infection, can, be, prolonged, because, dormant, larva, can, be, recruited, sequentially, from, tissue, store, see, pathology, above, over, many, year, to, replace, expired, adult, worm, this, can, give, rise, to, seasonal, fluctuation, in, infection, prevalence, and, intensity, apart, from, normal, seasonal, variation, in, transmission, civilian, public, service, worker, built, and, installed, outhouse, for, hookworm, eradication, in, mississippi, and, florida, from, to, they, mate, inside, the, host, female, laying, up, to, egg, per, day, and, some, to, million, egg, during, their, lifetime, which, pas, out, in, feces, because, it, take, week, for, adult, worm, to, mature, mate, and, produce, egg, in, the, early, stage, of, very, heavy, infection, acute, symptom, might, occur, without, any, egg, being, detected, in, the, patient, feces, this, can, make, diagnosis, very, difficult, summary, of, biological, life, cycle, americanus, and, duodenale, egg, can, be, found, in, warm, moist, soil, where, they, will, eventually, hatch, into, first, stage, larva, or, the, feeding, rhabditoform, stage, will, feed, on, soil, microbe, and, eventually, molt, into, second, stage, larva, which, is, also, in, the, rhabditoform, stage, will, feed, for, approximately, day, and, then, molt, into, the, third, stage, larva, or, is, the, filariform, stage, of, the, parasite, that, is, the, infective, form, of, the, larva, the, larva, are, extremely, motile, and, will, seek, higher, ground, to, increase, their, chance, of, penetrating, the, skin, of, a, human, host, the, larva, can, survive, up, to, week, without, finding, a, host, while, americanus, larva, only, infect, through, penetration, of, skin, duodenale, can, infect, both, through, penetration, a, well, a, orally, after, the, larva, have, successfully, entered, the, host, the, larva, then, travel, through, the, subcutaneous, venule, and, lymphatic, vessel, of, the, human, host, eventually, the, larva, enter, the, lung, through, the, pulmonary, capillary, and, break, out, into, the, alveolus, they, will, then, travel, up, the, trachea, to, be, coughed, and, swallowed, by, the, host, after, being, swallowed, the, larva, are, then, found, in, the, small, intestine, where, they, molt, into, the, or, adult, worm, stage, the, entire, process, from, skin, penetration, to, adult, development, take, about, week, the, female, adult, worm, will, release, egg, americanus, about, and, duodenale, which, are, passed, in, the, feces, of, the, human, host, these, egg, will, hatch, in, the, environment, within, several, day, and, the, cycle, will, start, anew, incubation, period, the, incubation, period, can, vary, between, a, few, week, to, many, month, and, is, largely, dependent, on, the, number, of, hookworm, parasite, an,

possible, in, early, infection, early, sign, of, infection, in, most, dog, include, limbular, limping, and, anal, itching, the, egg, are, oval, or, elliptical, measuring, by, colourless, not, bile, stained, and, with, a, thin, transparent, hyaline, shell, membrane, when, released, by, the, worm, in, the, intestine, the, egg, contains, an, unsegmented, ovum, during, it, passage, down, the, intestine, the, ovum, develops, and, thus, the, egg, passed, in, feces, have, a, segmented, ovum, usually, with, to, blastomere, a, the, egg, of, both, ancylostoma, and, necator, and, most, other, hookworm, specie, are, indistinguishable, to, identify, the, genus, they, must, be, cultured, in, the, lab, to, allow, larva, to, hatch, out, if, the, fecal, sample, is, left, for, a, day, or, more, under, tropical, condition, the, larva, will, have, hatched, out, so, egg, might, no, longer, be, evident, in, such, a, case, it, is, essential, to, distinguish, hookworm, from, strongyloides, larva, a, infection, with, the, latter, ha, more, serious, implication, and, requires, different, management, the, larva, of, the, two, hookworm, specie, can, also, be, distinguished, microscopically, although, this, would, not, be, done, routinely, but, usually, for, research, purpose, adult, worm, are, rarely, seen, except, via, endoscopy, surgery, or, autopsy, but, if, found, would, allow, definitive, identification, of, the, specie, classification, can, be, performed, based, on, the, length, of, the, buccal, cavity, the, space, between, the, oral, opening, and, the, esophagus, hookworm, rhabditoform, larva, have, long, buccal, cavity, whereas, strongyloides, rhabditoform, larva, have, short, buccal, cavity, recent, research, ha, focused, on, the, development, of, tool, for, diagnosis, of, infection, specific, identification, of, hookworm, and, analysis, of, genetic, variability, within, hookworm, population, because, hookworm, egg, are, often, indistinguishable, from,

prevention, of, roundworm, hookworm, heartworms, and, whipworms, ethiopian, child, treated, for, schistosoma, and, hookworm, child, edit, most, of, these, public, health, concern, have, focused, on, child, who, are, infected, with, hookworm, this, focus, on, child, is, largely, due, to, the, large, body, of, evidence, that, ha, demonstrated, strong, association, between, hookworm, infection, and, impaired, learning, increased, absence, from, school, and, decreased, future, economic, productivity, in, the, world, health, assembly, passed, a, resolution, demanding, member, state, to, attain, a, minimum, target, of, regular, deworming, of, at, least, of, all, school, child, by, the, year, a, world, health, organization, publication, reported, on, these, effort, to, treat, school, child, some, of, the, interesting, statistic, were, a, follows, only, out, of, endemic, country, were, able, to, reach, the, target, goal, and, le, than, million, child, of, the, total, million, at, risk, were, reached, which, mean, that, only, of, child, are, being, treated, for, hookworm, infection, mass, deworming, edit, mass, deworming, program, have, been, the, most, popular, strategy, to, address, the, issue, of, hookworm, infection, in, child, program, are, extremely, cost, effective, a, school, already, have, an, available, extensive, and, sustained, infrastructure, with, a, skilled, workforce, that, ha, a, close, relationship, with, the, community, with, little, training, from, a, local, health, system, teacher, can, easily, administer, the, drug, which, often, cost, le, than, u, per, child, per, year, recently, many, people, have, begun, to, question, if, the, program, are, necessarily, the, most, effective, approach, an, important, concern, with, program, is, that, they, often, do, not, reach, child, who, do, not, attend, school, thus, ignoring, a, large, amount, of, child, a, study, by, massa, et, al, continued, the, debate, regarding, program, they, examined, the, effect, of, treatment, versus, treatment, in, the, tanga, region, of, tanzania, a, major, conclusion, wa, that, the, mean, infection, intensity, of, hookworm, wa, significantly, lower, in, the, village, employing, the, treatment, approach, than, the, approach, the, treatment, model, used, in, this, specific, study, allowed, villager, to, take, control, of, the, child, treatment, by, having, villager, select, their, own, community, drug, distributor, to, administer, the, antihelminthic, drug, additionally, villager, organized, and, implemented, their, own, method, for, distributing, the, drug, to, all, child, the, positive, result, associated, with, this, new, model, highlight, the, need, for, community, involvement, in, deworming, campaign, public, health, education, edit, many, mass, deworming, program, also, combine, their, effort, with, a, public, health, education, these, health, education, program, often, stress, important, preventative, technique, such, a, washing, your, hand, before, eating, and, staying, away, from, contaminated, by, human, faeces, these, program, may, also, stress, that, shoe, must, be, worn, however, these, come, with, their, own, health, risk, and, may, not, be, effective, shoe, wearing, pattern, in, town, and, village, across, the, globe, are, determined, by, cultural, belief, and, the, level, of, education, within, that, society, the, wearing, of, shoe, will, prevent, the, entry, of, hookworm, infection, from, the, surrounding, soil, into, tender, skin, region, such, a, area, between, the, toe, sanitation, edit, historical, example, such, a, the, hookworm, campaign, in, mississippi, and, florida, from, to, have, shown, that, the, primary, cause, of, hookworm, infection, is, poor, sanitation, which, can, be, solved, by, building, and, maintaining, toilet, but, while, these, may, seem, like, simple, task, they, raise, important, public, health, challenge, most, infected, population, are, from, area, with, very, poor, sanitation, thus, it, is, most, likely, that, child, do, not, have, access, to, clean, water, to, wash, their, hand, and, live, in, environment, with, no, proper, sanitation, infrastructure, health, education, therefore, must, address, preventive, measure, in, way, that, are, both, feasible, and, sustainable, in, the, context, of, setting, integrated, approach, edit, evaluation, of, numerous, public, health, intervention, have, generally, shown, that, improvement, in, each, individual, component, ordinarily, attributed, to, poverty, for, example, sanitation, health, education, and, underlying, nutrition, status, often, have, minimal, impact, on, transmission, for, example, one, study, found, that, the, introduction, of, latrine, into, a, community, only, reduced, the, prevalence, of, hookworm, infection, by, four, percent, however, another, study, in, salvador, brazil, found, that, improved, drainage, and, sewerage, had, a, significant, impact, p, on, the, prevalence, of, hookworm, infection, but, no, impact, at, all, on, the, intensity, of, hookworm, infection, this, seems, to, suggest, that, environmental, control, alone, ha, a, limited, but, incomplete, effect, on, the, transmission, of, hookworm, it, is, imperative, therefore, that, more, research, be, performed, to, understand, the, efficacy, and, sustainability, of, integrated, program, that, combine, numerous, preventive, method, including, education, sanitation, and, treatment, treatment, edit, further, information, helminthiasis, treatment, anthelmintic, drug, edit, the, most, common, treatment, for, hookworm, are, benzimidazoles, specifically, albendazole, and, mebendazole, bzas, kill, adult, worm, by, binding, to, the, and, subsequently, inhibiting, microtubule, polymerization, within, the, parasite, in, certain, circumstance, levamisole, and, pyrantel, pamoate, may, be, used, the, study, by, keiser, and, utzinger, efficacy, of, current, drug, against, helminth, infection, systematic, review, and, examined, the, relative, efficacy, of, different, drug, treatment, they, found, that, the, efficacy, of, treatment, for, hookworm, infection, were, a, follows, for, albendazole, for, mebendazole, and, for, pyrantel, pamoate, this, substantiates, prior, claim, that, albendazole, is, much, more, effective, than, mebendazole, for, hookworm, infection, also, of, note, is, that, the, world, health, organization, doe, recommend, anthelmintic, treatment, in, pregnant, woman, after, the, first, trimester, it, is, also, recommended, that, if, the, patient, also, suffers, from, anemia, that, ferrous, sulfate, mg, be, administered, three, time, daily, at, the, same, time, a, anthelmintic, treatment, this, should, be, continued, until, hemoglobin, value, return, to, normal, which, could, take, up, to, month, hookworm, infection, can, be, treated, with, local, cryotherapy, when, the, hookworm, is, still, in, the, skin, albendazole, is, effective, both, in, the, intestinal, stage, and, during, the, stage, the, parasite, is, still, migrating, under, the, skin, in, case, of, anemia, iron, supplementation, can, cause, relief, symptom, of, iron, deficiency, anemia, however, a, red, blood, cell, level, are, restored, shortage, of, other, essential, such, a, folic, acid, or, vitamin, may, develop, so, these, might, also, be, supplemented, reinfection, and, drug, resistance, edit, other, important, issue, related, to, the, treatment, of, hookworm, are, reinfection, and, drug, resistance, it, ha, been, shown, that, reinfection, after, treatment, can, be, extremely, high, some, study, even, show, that, of, pretreatment, hookworm, infection, rate, can, be, seen, in, treated, community, within, month, while, reinfection, may, occur, it, is, still, recommended, that, regular, treatment, be, conducted, a, it, will, minimize, the, occurrence, of, chronic, outcome, there, are, also, increasing, concern, about, the, issue, of, drug, resistance, drug, resistance, ha, appeared, in, anthelmintic, used, for, livestock, nematode, generally, human, nematode, are, le, likely, to, develop, resistance, due, to, longer, reproducing, time, le, frequent, treatment, and, more, targeted, treatment, nonetheless, the, global, community, must, be, careful, to, maintain, the, effectiveness, of, current,

this, have, led, to, an, increased, interest, in, the, topic, of, anemia, during, pregnancy, with, the, understanding, that, chronic, hookworm, infection, can, often, lead, to, anemia, many, people, are, now, questioning, if, the, treatment, of, hookworm, could, effect, change, in, severe, anemia, rate, and, thus, also, on, maternal, and, child, health, a, well, most, evidence, suggests, that, the, contribution, of, hookworm, to, maternal, anemia, merit, that, all, woman, of, age, living, in, endemic, area, be, subject, to, periodic, anthelmintic, treatment, the, world, health, organization, even, recommends, that, infected, pregnant, woman, be, treated, after, their, first, trimester, regardless, of, these, suggestion, only, madagascar, nepal, and, sri, lanka, have, added, deworming, to, their, antenatal, care, program, this, lack, of, deworming, of, pregnant, woman, is, explained, by, the, fact, that, most, individual, still, fear, that, anthelmintic, treatment, will, result, in, adverse, birth, outcome, but, a, study, by, gyorkos, et, al, found, that, when, comparing, a, group, of, pregnant, woman, treated, with, mebendazole, with, a, control, placebo, group, both, illustrated, rather, similar, rate, in, adverse, birth, outcome, the, treated, group, demonstrated, adverse, birth, outcome, while, the, control, group, had, adverse, birth, outcome, furthermore, larocque, et, al, illustrated, that, treatment, for, hookworm, infection, actually, led, to, positive, health, result, in, the, infant, this, study, concluded, that, treatment, with, mebendazole, plus, iron, supplement, during, antenatal, care, significantly, reduced, the, proportion, of, very, low, birth, weight, infant, when, compared, to, a, placebo, control, group, study, so,

a, quarter, of, african, schoolchildren, million, child, aged, year, may, be, coincidentally, of, both, falciparum, and, hookworm, while, original, hypothesis, stated, that, with, multiple, parasite, would, impair, the, immune, response, to, a, single, parasite, and, increase, susceptibility, to, clinical, disease, study, have, yielded, contrasting, result, for, example, one, study, in, senegal, showed, that, the, risk, of, clinical, malaria, infection, wa, increased, in, child, in, comparison, to, child, while, other, study, have, failed, to, reproduce, such, result, and, even, among, laboratory, mouse, experiment, the, effect, of, helminth, on, malaria, is, variable, some, hypothesis, and, study, suggest, that, helminth, infection, may, protect, against, cerebral, malaria, due, to, the, possible, modulation, of, and, cytokine, response, furthermore, the, mechanism, underlying, this, supposed, increased, susceptibility, to, disease, are, unknown, for, example, helminth, infection, cause, potent, and, highly, polarized, immune, response, characterized, by, increased, cell, type, cytokine, and, immunoglobulin, e, ige, production, however, the, effect, of, such, response, on, the, human, immune, response, is, unknown, additionally, both, malaria, and, helminth, infection, can, cause, anemia, but, the, effect, of, and, possible, enhancement, of, anemia, is, poorly, understood, citation, needed, hygiene, hypothesis, edit, the, hygiene, hypothesis, state, that, infant, and, child, who, lack, exposure, to, infectious, agent, are, more, susceptible, to, allergic, disease, via, modulation, of, immune, system, development, a, mary, ruebush, writes, in, her, book, why, dirt, is, good, a, child, is, doing, when, he, put, thing, in, his, mouth, is, allowing, his, immune, response, to, explore, his, environment, not, only, doe, this, allow, for, of, immune, response, which, will, be, necessary, for, protection, but, it, also, play, a, critical, role, in, teaching, the, immature, immune, response, what, is, best, ignored, the, theory, wa, first, proposed, by, david, strachan, who, noted, that, hay, fever, and, eczema, were, le, common, in, child, who, belonged, to, large, family, since, then, study, have, noted, the, effect, of, gastrointestinal, worm, on, the, development, of, allergy, in, the, developing, world, for, example, a, study, in, gambia, found, that, eradication, of, worm, in, some, village, led, to, increased, skin, reaction, to, allergy, among, child, although, the, exact, mechanism, is, unknown, scientist, hypothesize, that, the, helper, t, cell, are, key, player, allergic, disease, which, are, immunological, response, to, normally, harmless, antigen, are, driven, by, a, immune, response, bacteria, virus, and, parasite, on, the, other, hand, elicit, a, immune, response, which, inhibits, or, the, response, also, inhibits, the, activity, of, which, is, heightened, in, numerous, inflammatory, disease, including, multiple, sclerosis, and, asthma, more, research, is, currently, being, performed, to, better, understand, the, possible, mechanism, for, the, hygiene, hypothesis, vaccine, edit, main, article, hookworm, vaccine, while, annual, or, mass, antihelminthic, administration, is, a, critical, aspect, of, any, public, health, intervention, many, have, begun, to, realize, how, unsustainable, it, is, due, to, aspect, such, a, poverty, high, rate, of, and, diminished, efficacy, of, drug, with, repeated, use, current, research, therefore, ha, focused, on, the, development, of, a, vaccine, that, could, be, integrated, into, existing, control, program, the, goal, of, vaccine, development, is, not, necessarily, to, create, a, vaccine, with, sterilizing, immunity, or, complete, protection, against, immunity, a, vaccine, that, reduces, the, likelihood, of, vaccinated, individual, developing, severe, infection, and, thus, reduced, blood, and, nutrient, level, could, still, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, high, burden, of, disease, throughout, the, world, current, research, focus, on, targeting, two, stage, in, the, development, of, the, worm, the, larval, stage, and, the, adult, stage, research, on, larval, antigen, ha, focused, on, protein, that, are, member, of, the, protein, superfamily, ancylostoma, secreted, protein, although, they, were, first, described, in, anyclostoma, these, protein, have, also, been, successfully, isolated, from, the, secreted, product, of, americanus, americanus, is, currently, the, leading, hookworm, vaccine, candidate, a, randomized, study, ha, already, been, performed, healthy, adult, without, a, history, of, hookworm, infection, were, given, three, intramuscular, injection, of, three, different, concentration, of, and, observed, for, six, month, after, the, final, vaccination, the, vaccine, induced, significant, igg, and, cellular, immune, response, in, addition, it, wa, safe, and, produced, no, debilitating, side, effect, the, vaccine, is, now, in, a, phase, one, trial, healthy, adult, volunteer, with, documented, evidence, of, previous, infection, in, brazil, are, being, given, the, same, dose, concentration, on, the, same, schedule, used, in, the, initial, study, if, this, study, is, successful, the, next, step, would, be, to, conduct, a, phase, two, trial, to, ass, the, rate, and, intensity, of, hookworm, infection, among, vaccinated, person, because, the, vaccine, only, target, the, larval, stage, it, is, critical, that, all, subject, enrolled, in, the, study, be, treated, with, antihelminthic, drug, to, eliminate, adult, worm, prior, to, vaccination, adult, hookworm, antigen, have, also, been, identified, a, potential, candidate, for, vaccine, when, adult, worm, attach, to, the, intestinal, mucosa, of, the, human, host, erythrocyte, are, ruptured, in, the, digestive, tract, which, cause, the, release, of, free, hemoglobin, which, is, subsequently, degraded, by, a, proteolytic, cascade, several, of, these, protein, that, are, responsible, for, this, proteolytic, cascade, are, also, essential, for, the, nutrition, and, survival, therefore, a, vaccine, that, could, induce, antibody, for, these, antigen, could, interfere, with, the, digestive, pathway, and, impair, the, survival, three, protein, have, been, identified, the, aspartic, the, cysteine, and, a, glutathione, vaccination, with, and, led, to, reduced, host, blood, loss, and, fecal, egg, count, in, dog, with, vaccination, even, led, to, reduced, worm, burden, research, is,

to, prevent, airborne, transmission, microorganism, transmitted, by, airborne, transmission, include, legionella, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, and, the, rubeola, and, varicella, virus, common, vehicle, transmission, this, applies, to, microorganism, transmitted, to, the, host, by, contaminated, item, such, a, food, water, medication, device, and, equipment, vector, borne, transmission,

after, each, patient, contact, is, one, of, the, most, effective, way, to, combat, nosocomial, infection, more, careful, use, of, antimicrobial, agent, such, a, antibiotic, is, also, considered, vital, despite, sanitation, protocol, patient, can, not, be, entirely, isolated, from, infectious, agent, furthermore, patient, are, often, prescribed, antibiotic, and, other, antimicrobial, drug, to, help, treat, illness, this, may, increase, the, selection, pressure, for, the, emergence, of, resistant, strain, sterilization, edit, sterilization, go, further, than, just, sanitizing, it, kill, all,

because, agent, and, host, factor, are, more, difficult, to, control, interruption, of, transfer, of, microorganism, is, directed, primarily, at, transmission, for, example, isolation, of, infectious, case, in, special, hospital, and, isolation, of, patient, with, infected, wound, in, special, room, also, isolation, of, joint, transplantation, patient, on, specific, room, handwashing, edit, handwashing, frequently, is, called, the, single, most, important, measure, to, reduce, the, risk, of, transmitting, skin, microorganism, from, one, person, to, another, or, from, one, site, to, another, on, the, same, patient, washing, hand, a, promptly, and, thoroughly, a, possible, between, patient, contact, and, after, contact, with, blood, body, fluid, secretion, excretion, and, equipment, or, article, contaminated, by, them, is, an, important, component, of, infection, control, and, isolation, precaution, the, spread, of, nosocomial, infection, among, immunocompromised, patient, is, connected, with, health, care, worker, hand, contamination, in, almost, of, case, and, is, a, challenging, problem, in, the, modern, hospital, the, best, way, for, worker, to, overcome, this, problem, is, conducting, correct, procedure, this, is, why, the, who, launched, in, the, global, patient, safety, challenge, two, category, of, can, be, present, on, health, care, worker, hand, transient, flora, and, resident, flora, the, first, is, represented, by, the, taken, by, worker, from, the, environment, and, the, bacteria, in, it, are, capable, of, surviving, on, the, human, skin, and, sometimes, to, grow, the, second, group, is, represented, by, the, permanent, living, on, the, skin, surface, on, the, stratum, corneum, or, immediately, under, it, they, are, capable, of, surviving, on, the, human, skin, and, to, grow, freely, on, it, they, have, low, pathogenicity, and, infection, rate, and, they, create, a, kind, of, protection, from, the, colonization, from, other, more, pathogenic, bacteria, the, skin, of, worker, is, colonized, by, x, x, the, microbe, comprising, the, resident, flora, are, staphylococcus, epidermidis, hominis, and, microccocus, propionibacterium, corynebacterium, dermobacterium, and, pitosporum, while, in, the, transitional, could, be, found, aureus, and, klebsiella, pneumoniae, and, acinetobacter, enterobacter, and, candida, spp, the, goal, of, hand, hygiene, is, to, eliminate, the, transient, flora, with, a, careful, and, proper, performance, of, hand, washing, using, different, kind, of, soap, normal, and, antiseptic, and, gel, the, main, problem, found, in, the, practice, of, hand, hygiene, is, connected, with, the, lack, of, available, sink, and, performance, of, hand, washing, an, easy, way, to, resolve, this, problem, could, be, the, use, of, hand, rub, because, of, faster, application, compared, to, correct, handwashing, all, visitor, must, follow, the, same, procedure, a, hospital, staff, to, adequately, control, the, spread, of, infection, visitor, and, healthcare, personnel, are, equally, to, blame, in, transmitting, infection, citation, needed, moreover, infection, can, leave, the, hospital, and, become, part, of, the, community, flora, if, step, are, not, taken, to, stop, this, transmission, a, of, it, is, unclear, whether, or, not, nail, polish, or, ring, affected, surgical, wound, infection, rate, glove, edit, in, addition, to, handwashing, glove, play, an, important, role, in, reducing, the, risk, of, transmission, of, microorganism, glove, are, worn, for, three, important, reason, in, hospital, first, they, are, worn, to, provide, a, protective, barrier, for, personnel, preventing, gross, contamination, of, the, hand, when, touching, blood, body, fluid, secretion, excretion, mucous, membrane, and, nonintact, skin, in, the, usa, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, ha, mandated, wearing, glove, to, reduce, the, risk, of, bloodborne, pathogen, infection, second, glove, are, worn, to, reduce, the, likelihood, that, microorganism, present, on, the, hand, of, personnel, will, be, transmitted, to, patient, during, invasive, or, other, procedure, that, involve, touching, a, patient, mucous, membrane, and, nonintact, skin, third, they, are, worn, to, reduce, the, likelihood, that, the, hand, of, personnel, contaminated, with, from, a, patient, or, a, fomite, can, transmit, those, to, another, patient, in, this, situation, glove, must, be, changed, between, patient, contact, and, hand, should, be, washed, after, glove, are,

from, puerperal, fever, semmelweis, immediately, proposed, a, connection, between, cadaveric, contamination, and, puerperal, fever, he, concluded, that, he, and, the, medical, student, carried, cadaverous, particle, on, their, hand, note, from, the, autopsy, room, to, the, patient, they, examined, in, the, first, obstetrical, clinic, this, explained, why, the, student, midwife, in, the,

semmelweis, concluded, some, unknown, cadaverous, material, caused, childbed, fever, he, instituted, a, policy, of, using, a, solution, of, chlorinated, lime, calcium, hypochlorite, for, washing, hand, between, autopsy, work, and, the, examination, of, patient, he, did, this, because, he, found, that, this, chlorinated, solution, worked, best, to, remove, the, putrid, smell, of, infected, autopsy, tissue, and, thus, perhaps, destroyed, the, causal, poisonous, or, contaminating, cadaveric, agent, hypothetically, being, transmitted, by, this, material, the, result, wa, the, mortality, rate, in, the, first, clinic, dropped, and, wa, then, comparable, to, that, in, the, second, clinic, the, mortality, rate, in, april, wa, after, hand, washing, wa, instituted, in, the, rate, in, june,

to, a, tragic, conclusion, however, he, wa, ultimately, vindicated, while, employed, a, assistant, to, the, professor, of, the, maternity, clinic, at, the, vienna, general, hospital, in, austria, in,

warning, against, all, decaying, organic, matter, not, just, against, a, specific, contagion, that, originated, from, victim, of, childbed, fever, themselves, this, misunderstanding, and, others,

published, nothing, these, and, similar, misinterpretation, would, continue, to, cloud, discussion, of, his, work, throughout, the, century, some, account, emphasize, that, semmelweis, refused, to,

insisted, that, other, factor, beyond, decaying, organic, matter, certainly, had, to, be, included, in, the, etiology, of, the, disease, carl, edvard, marius, levy, head, of, the, copenhagen, maternity, hospital, and, an, outspoken, critic, of, semmelweis, idea, had, reservation, concerning, the, unspecific, nature, of, cadaverous, particle, and, that, the, supposed, quantity, were, unreasonably, small, if, semmelweis, had, limited, his, opinion, regarding, infection, from, corps, to, puerperal, corps, i, would, have, been, le, disposed, to, denial, than, i, am, and, with, due, respect, for, the, cleanliness, of, the, viennese, student, it, seems, improbable, that, enough, infective, matter, or, vapor, could, be, secluded, around, the, fingernail, to, kill, a, patient, in,

of, recognition, of, the, semmelweis, doctrine, for, a, long, time, it, ha, been, contended, that, semmelweis, could, have, had, an, even, greater, impact, if, he, had, managed, to, communicate, his,

out, against, his, critic, in, a, series, of, open, letter, note, they, were, addressed, to, various, prominent, european, obstetrician, including, scanzoni, siebold, and, to, all, obstetrician, they, were, full, of, bitterness, desperation, and, fury, and, were, highly, polemical, and, superlatively, offensive, at, time, denouncing, his, critic, a, irresponsible, murderer, or, ignoramus, he, also, called, upon, siebold, to, arrange, a, meeting, of, german, obstetrician, somewhere, in, germany, to, provide, a, forum, for, discussion, on, puerperal, fever, where, he, would, stay, until, all,

during, the, visit, semmelweis, behavior, seemed, particularly, inappropriate, the, exact, nature, of, affliction, ha, been, a, subject, of, some, debate, according, to, k, codell, carter, in, his, biography, of, semmelweis, the, exact, nature, of, his, affliction, can, not, be, determined, is, impossible, to, appraise, the, nature, of, semmelweis, disorder, it, may, have, been, learned, helplessness, which, is, known, to, cause, chronic, and, severe, depression, it, may, have, been, alzheimer, disease, a, type, of, dementia, which, is, associated, with, rapid, cognitive, decline, and, mood, change, it, may, have, been, syphilis, a, disease, of, obstetrician, who, examined, thousand, of, woman, at, gratis, institution, or, it, may, have, been, emotional, exhaustion, from,

that, the, infectious, agent, be, identified, only, in, patient, and, not, in, healthy, control, and, that, patient, who, contract, the, agent, also, develop, the, disease, these, postulate, were, first, used, in, the, discovery, that, mycobacteria, specie, cause, tuberculosis, koch, postulate, can, not, be, applied, ethically, for, many, human, disease, because, they, require, experimental, infection, of, a, healthy, individual, with, a, pathogen, produced, a, a, pure, culture, often, even, clearly, infectious, disease, do, not, meet, the, infectious, criterion, for, example, treponema,

presentation, conclusion, about, the, cause, of, the, disease, are, based, upon, the, likelihood, that, a, patient, came, in, contact, with, a, particular, agent, the, presence, of, a, microbe, in, a, community, and, other, epidemiological, consideration, given, sufficient, effort, all, known, infectious, agent, can, be, specifically, identified, the, benefit, of, identification, however, are, often, greatly, outweighed, by, the, cost, a, often, there, is, no, specific, treatment, the, cause, is, obvious, or, the, outcome, of, an, infection, is, benign, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, is, nearly, always, initiated, by, medical, history, and, physical, examination, more, detailed, identification, technique, involve, the, culture, of, infectious, agent, isolated, from, a, patient,

culture, is, a, principal, tool, used, to, diagnose, infectious, disease, in, a, microbial, culture, a, growth, medium, is, provided, for, a, specific, agent, a, sample, taken, from, potentially, diseased, tissue, or, fluid, is, then, tested, for, the, presence, of, an, infectious, agent, able, to, grow, within, that, medium, most, pathogenic, bacteria, are, easily, grown, on, nutrient, agar, a, form, of, solid, medium, that, supply, carbohydrate, and, protein, necessary, for, growth, of, a, bacterium, along, with, copious, amount, of, water, a, single, bacterium, will, grow, into, a, visible, mound, on, the, surface, of, the, plate, called, a, colony, which, may, be, separated, from, other, colony, or, melded, together, into, a, lawn, the, size, color, shape, and, form, of, a, colony, is, characteristic, of, the, bacterial, specie, it, specific, genetic, makeup, it, strain, and, the, environment, which, support, it, growth, other, ingredient, are, often, added, to, the, plate, to, aid, in, identification, plate, may, contain, substance, that, permit, the, growth, of, some, bacteria, and, not, others, or, that, change, color, in, response, to, certain, bacteria, and, not, others, bacteriological, plate, such, a, these, are, commonly, used, in, the, clinical, identification, of, infectious, bacterium, microbial, culture, may, also, be, used, in, the, identification, of, virus, the, medium, in, this, case, being, cell, grown, in, culture, that, the, virus, can, infect, and, then, alter, or, kill, in, the, case, of, viral, identification, a, region, of, dead, cell, result, from, viral, growth, and, is, called, a, plaque, eukaryotic, parasite, may, also, be, grown, in, culture, a, a, mean, of, identifying, a, particular, agent, in, the, absence, of, suitable, plate, culture, technique, some, microbe, require, culture, within, live, animal, bacteria, such, a, mycobacterium, leprae, and, treponema, pallidum, can, be, grown, in, animal, although, serological, and, microscopic, technique, make, the, use, of, live, animal, unnecessary, virus, are, also, usually, identified, using, alternative, to, growth, in, culture, or, animal, some, virus, may, be, grown, in, embryonated, egg, another, useful, identification, method, is, xenodiagnosis, or, the, use, of, a, vector, to, support, the, growth, of, an, infectious, agent, chaga, disease, is, the, most, significant, example, because, it, is, difficult, to, directly, demonstrate, the, presence, of, the, causative, agent, trypanosoma, cruzi, in, a, patient, which, therefore, make, it, difficult, to, definitively, make, a, diagnosis, in, this, case, xenodiagnosis, involves, the, use, of, the, vector, of, the, chaga, agent, cruzi, an, uninfected, triatomine, bug, which, take, a, blood, meal, from, a, person, suspected, of, having, been, infected, the, bug, is, later, inspected, for, growth, of, cruzi, within, it, gut, microscopy, edit, another, principal, tool, in, the, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, is, microscopy, virtually, all, of, the, culture, technique, discussed, above, rely, at, some, point, on, microscopic, examination, for, definitive, identification, of, the, infectious, agent, microscopy, may, be, carried, out, with, simple, instrument, such, a, the, compound, light, microscope, or, with, instrument, a, complex, a, an, electron, microscope, sample, obtained, from, patient, may, be, viewed, directly, under, the, light, microscope, and, can, often, rapidly, lead, to, identification, microscopy, is, often, also, used, in, conjunction, with, biochemical, staining, technique, and, can, be, made, exquisitely, specific, when, used, in, combination, with, antibody, based, technique, for, example, the, use, of, antibody, made, artificially, fluorescent, fluorescently, labeled, antibody, can, be, directed, to, bind, to, and, identify, a, specific, antigen, present, on, a, pathogen, a, fluorescence, microscope, is, then, used, to, detect, fluorescently, labeled, antibody, bound, to, internalized, antigen, within, clinical, sample, or, cultured, cell, this, technique, is, especially, useful, in, the, diagnosis, of, viral, disease, where, the, light, microscope, is, incapable, of, identifying, a, virus, directly, other, microscopic, procedure, may, also, aid, in, identifying, infectious, agent, almost, all, cell, readily, stain, with, a, number, of, basic, dye, due, to, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, negatively, charged, cellular, molecule, and, the, positive, charge, on, the, dye, a, cell, is, normally, transparent, under, a, microscope, and, using, a, stain, increase, the, contrast, of, a, cell, with, it, background, staining, a, cell, with, a, dye, such, a, giemsa, stain, or, crystal, violet, allows, a, microscopist, to, describe, it, size, shape, internal, and, external, component, and, it, association, with, other, cell, the, response, of, bacteria, to, different, staining, procedure, is, used, in, the, taxonomic, classification, of, microbe, a, well, two, method, the, gram, stain, and, the, stain, are, the, standard, approach, used, to, classify, bacteria, and, to, diagnosis, of, disease, the, gram, stain, identifies, the, bacterial, group, firmicutes, and, actinobacteria, both, of, which, contain, many, significant, human, pathogen, the, staining, procedure, identifies, the, actinobacterial, genus, mycobacterium, and, nocardia, biochemical, test, edit, biochemical, test, used, in, the, identification, of, infectious, agent, include, the, detection, of, metabolic, or, enzymatic, product, characteristic, of, a, particular, infectious, agent, since, bacteria, ferment, carbohydrate, in, pattern, characteristic, of, their, genus, and, specie, the, detection, of, fermentation, product, is, commonly, used, in, bacterial, identification, acid, alcohol, and, gas, are, usually, detected, in, these, test, when, bacteria, are, grown, in, selective, liquid, or, solid, medium, the, isolation, of, enzyme, from, infected, tissue, can, also, provide, the, basis, of, a, biochemical, diagnosis, of, an, infectious, disease, for, example, human, can, make, neither, rna, replica, nor, reverse, transcriptase, and, the, presence, of, these, enzyme, are, characteristic, of, specific, type, of, viral, infection, the, ability, of, the, viral, protein, hemagglutinin, to, bind, red, blood, cell, together, into, a, detectable, matrix, may, also, be, characterized, a, a, biochemical, test, for, viral, infection, although, strictly, speaking,

these, test, are, based, upon, the, ability, of, an, antibody, to, bind, specifically, to, an, antigen, the, antigen, usually, a, protein, or, carbohydrate, made, by, an, infectious, agent, is, bound, by, the, antibody, this, binding, then, set, off, a, chain, of, event, that, can, be, visibly, obvious, in, various, way, dependent, upon, the, test, for, example, strep, throat, is, often, diagnosed, within, minute, and, is, based, on, the, appearance, of, antigen, made, by, the, causative, agent, pyogenes, that, is, retrieved, from, a, patient, throat, with, a, cotton, swab, serological, test, if, available, are, usually, the, preferred, route, of, identification, however, the, test, are, costly, to, develop, and, the, reagent, used, in, the, test, often, require, refrigeration, some,

nearly, ubiquitous, gold, standard, of, diagnostics, of, the, near, future, for, several, reason, first, the, catalog, of, infectious, agent, ha, grown, to, the, point, that, virtually, all, of, the, significant, infectious, agent, of, the, human, population, have, been, identified, second, an, infectious, agent, must, grow, within, the, human, body, to, cause, disease, essentially, it, must, amplify, it, own, nucleic, acid, in, order, to, cause, a, disease, this, amplification, of, nucleic, acid, in, infected, tissue, offer, an, opportunity, to, detect, the, infectious, agent, by, using, pcr, third, the, essential, tool, for, directing, pcr, primer, are, derived, from, the, genome, of, infectious, agent, and, with, time, those, genome, will, be, known, if, they, are, not, already, thus, the, technological, ability, to, detect, any, infectious, agent, rapidly, and, specifically, are, currently, available, the, only, remaining, blockade, to, the, use, of, pcr, a, a, standard, tool, of, diagnosis, are, in, it, cost, and, application, neither, of, which, is, insurmountable, the, diagnosis, of, a, few, disease, will, not, benefit, from, the, development, of, pcr, method, such, a, some, of, the, clostridial, disease, tetanus, and, botulism, these, disease, are, fundamentally, biological, poisoning, by, relatively, small, number, of, infectious, bacteria, that, produce,

of, test, edit, there, is, usually, an, indication, for, a, specific, identification, of, an, infectious, agent, only, when, such, identification, can, aid, in, the, treatment, or, prevention, of, the, disease, or, to, advance, knowledge, of, the, course, of, an, illness, prior, to, the, development, of, effective, therapeutic, or, preventative, measure, for, example, in, the, early, prior, to,

would, not, offer, the, patient, any, further, treatment, option, in, part, these, study, on, the, appearance, of, hiv, in, specific, community, permitted, the, advancement, of, hypothesis, a, to, the, route, of, transmission, of, the, virus, by, understanding, how, the, disease, wa, transmitted, resource, could, be, targeted, to, the, community, at, greatest, risk, in, campaign, aimed, at, reducing, the, number, of, new, infection, the, specific, serological, diagnostic, identification, and, later, genotypic, or, molecular, identification, of, hiv, also, enabled, the, development, of, hypothesis, a, to, the, temporal, and, geographical, origin, of, the, virus, a, well, a, a, myriad, of, other, hypothesis, the, development, of, molecular, diagnostic, tool, have, enabled, physician,

prevent, transmission, of, infection, include, antiseptic, which, are, applied, to, living, disinfectant, which, destroy, microorganism, found, on, object, antibiotic, called, prophylactic, when, given, a, prevention, rather, a, treatment, of, infection, however, long, term, use, of, antibiotic, lead, to, resistance, and, chance, of, developing, opportunistic, infection, like, clostridium, difficile, colitis, thus, avoiding, using, antibiotic, longer, than, necessary, help, preventing, such, infectious, disease, one, of, the, way, to, prevent, or, slow, down, the, transmission, of, infectious, disease, is, to, recognize, the, different, characteristic, of, various, disease, some, critical, disease, characteristic, that, should, be, evaluated, include, virulence, distance, traveled, by, victim, and, level, of, contagiousness, the, human, strain, of, ebola, virus, for, example, incapacitate, their, victim, extremely, quickly, and, kill, them, soon, after, a, a, result, the, victim, of, this, disease, do, not, have, the, opportunity, to, travel, very, far, from, the, initial, infection, zone, also, this, virus, must, spread, through, skin, lesion, or, permeable, membrane, such, a, the, eye, thus, the, initial, stage, of, ebola, is, not, very, contagious, since, it, victim, experience, only, internal, hemorrhaging, a, a, result, of, the, above, feature, the, spread, of, ebola, is, very, rapid, and, usually, stay, within, a, relatively, confined, geographical, area, in, contrast, the, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, kill, it, victim, very, slowly, by,

relatively, low, virulence, allows, it, victim, to, travel, long, distance, increasing, the, likelihood, of, an, epidemic, another, effective, way, to, decrease, the, transmission, rate, of, infectious, disease, is, to, recognize, the, effect, of, network, in, epidemic, there, are, often, extensive, interaction, within, hub, or, group, of, infected, individual, and, other, interaction, within, discrete, hub, of, susceptible, individual, despite, the, low, interaction, between, discrete, hub, the, disease, can, jump, to, and, spread, in, a, susceptible, hub, via, a, single, or, few, interaction, with, an, infected, hub, thus, infection, rate, in, network, can, be, reduced, somewhat, if, interaction, between, individual, within, infected, hub, are, eliminated, figure, however, infection, rate, can, be, drastically, reduced, if, the, main, focus, is, on, the, prevention, of, transmission, jump, between, hub, the, use, of, needle, exchange, program, in, area, with, a, high, density, of, drug, user, with, hiv, is, an, example, of, the, successful, implementation, of, this, treatment, method, another, example, is, the, use, of, ring, culling, or, vaccination, of,

often, the, bacterial, endospore, is, selected, a, the, standard, challenge, if, the, process, kill, this, microorganism, the, sterilizer, is, considered, to, be, effective, it, should, be, noted, that, in, order, to, be, effective, instrument, must, be, cleaned, otherwise, the, debris, may, form, a, protective, barrier, shielding, the, microbe, from, the, lethal, process, similarly, care,

stream, and, sterile, tissue, there, are, four, main, way, in, which, such, item, can, be, sterilized, autoclave, by, using, steam, dry, heat, in, an, oven, by, using, chemical, sterilants, such, a, glutaraldehydes, or, formaldehyde, solution, or, by, radiation, with, the, help, of, physical, agent, the, first, two, are, the, most, used, method, of, sterilization, mainly, because, of, their, accessibility, and, availability, steam, sterilization, is, one, of, the, most, effective, type, of, sterilization, if, done, correctly, which, is, often, hard, to, achieve, instrument, that, are, used, in, health, care, facility, are, usually, sterilized, with, this, method, the, general, rule, in, this, case, is, that, in, order, to, perform, an, effective, sterilization, the, steam, must, get, into, contact, with, all, the, surface, that, are, meant, to, be, disinfected, on, the, other, hand, dry, heat, sterilization, which, is, performed, with, the, help, of, an, oven, is, also, an, accessible, type, of, sterilization, although, it, can, only, be, used, to, disinfect, instrument, that, are, made, of, metal, or, glass, the, very, high, temperature, needed, to, perform, sterilization, in, this, way, are, able, to, melt, the, instrument, that, are, not, made, of, glass, or, metal, steam, sterilization, is, done, at, a, temperature, of, c, f, with, a, pressure, of, kpa, in, these, condition, unwrapped, item, must, be, sterilized, for, minute, and, wrapped, item, for, minute, the, time, is, counted, once, the, temperature, that, is, needed, ha, been, reached, steam, sterilization, requires, four, condition, in, order, to, be, efficient, adequate, contact, sufficiently, high, temperature, correct, time, and, sufficient, moisture, sterilization, using, steam, can, also, be, done, at, a, temperature, of, c, f, at, a, double, pressure, dry, heat, sterilization, is, performed, at, c, f, for, one, hour, or, two, hour, at, a, temperature, of, c, f, dry, heat, sterilization, can, also, be, performed, at, c, for, at, least, hour, chemical, sterilization, also, referred, to, a, cold, sterilization, can, be, used, to, sterilize, instrument, that, can, not, normally, be, disinfected, through, the, other, two, process, described, above, the, item, sterilized, with, cold, sterilization, are, usually, those, that, can, be, damaged, by, regular, sterilization, commonly, glutaraldehydes, and, formaldehyde, are, used, in, this, process, but, in, different, way, when, using, the, first, type, of, disinfectant, the, instrument, are, soaked, in, a, solution, for, at, least, hour, while, a, solution, of, formaldehyde, will, sterilize, the, item, in, hour, or, more, chemical, sterilization, is, generally, more, expensive, than, steam, sterilization, and, therefore, it, is, used, for, instrument, that, can, not, be, disinfected, otherwise, after, the, instrument, have, been, soaked, in, the, chemical, solution, they, are, mandatory, to, be, rinsed, with, sterile, water, which, will, remove, the, residue, from, the, disinfectant, this, is, the, reason, why, needle, and, syrinx, are, not, sterilized, in, this, way, a, the, residue, left, by, the, chemical, solution, that, ha, been, used, to, disinfect, them, can, not, be, washed, off, with, water, and, they, may, interfere, with, the, administered, treatment, although, formaldehyde, is, le, expensive, than, glutaraldehydes, it, is, also, more, irritating, to, the, eye, skin, and, respiratory, tract, and, is, classified, a, a, potential, carcinogen, other,

the, likelihood, that, a, patient, came, in, contact, with, a, particular, agent, the, presence, of, a, microbe, in, a, community, and, other, epidemiological, consideration, given, sufficient, effort, all, known, infectious, agent, can, be, specifically, identified, the, benefit, of, identification, however, are, often, greatly, outweighed, by, the, cost, a, often, there, is, no, specific, treatment, the, cause, is, obvious, or, the, outcome, of, an, infection, is, benign, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, is, nearly, always, initiated, by, medical, history, and, physical, examination, more, detailed, identification, technique, involve, the, culture, of, infectious, agent, isolated, from, a, patient, culture, allows, identification, of, infectious, organism, by, examining, their, microscopic, feature, by, detecting, the, presence, of, substance, produced, by, pathogen, and, by, directly, identifying, an, organism, by, it, genotype, other, technique, such, a, cat, scan, pet, scan, or, nmr, are, used, to, produce, image, of, internal, abnormality, resulting, from, the, growth, of, an, infectious, agent, the, image, are, useful, in, detection, of, for, example, a, bone, abscess, or, a, spongiform, encephalopathy, produced, by, a, prion, symptomatic, diagnostics, edit, the, diagnosis, is, aided, by, the, presenting, symptom, in, any, individual, with, an, infectious, disease, yet, it, usually, need, additional, diagnostic, technique, to, confirm, the, suspicion, some, sign, are, specifically, characteristic, and, indicative, of, a, disease, and, are, called, pathognomonic, sign, but, these, are, rare, not, all, infection, are, symptomatic, in, child, the, presence, of, cyanosis, rapid, breathing, poor, peripheral, perfusion, or, a, petechial, rash, increase, the, risk, of, a, serious, infection, by, greater, than, fold, other, important, indicator, include, parental, concern, clinical, instinct, and, temperature, greater, than, microbial, culture, edit, four, nutrient, agar, plate, growing, colony, of, common, gram, negative, bacteria, microbiological, culture, is, a, principal, tool, used, to, diagnose, infectious, disease, in, a, microbial, culture, a, growth, medium, is, provided, for, a, specific, agent, a, sample, taken, from, potentially, diseased, tissue, or, fluid, is, then, tested, for, the, presence, of, an, infectious, agent, able, to, grow, within, that, medium, most, pathogenic, bacteria, are, easily, grown, on, nutrient, agar, a, form, of, solid, medium, that, supply, carbohydrate, and, protein, necessary, for, growth, of, a, bacterium, along, with, copious, amount, of, water, a, single, bacterium, will, grow, into, a, visible, mound, on, the, surface, of, the, plate, called, a, colony, which, may, be, separated, from, other, colony, or, melded, together, into, a, lawn, the, size, color, shape, and, form, of, a, colony, is, characteristic, of, the, bacterial, specie, it, specific, genetic, makeup, it, strain, and, the, environment, which, support, it, growth, other, ingredient, are, often, added, to, the, plate, to, aid, in, identification, plate, may, contain, substance, that, permit, the, growth, of, some, bacteria, and, not, others, or, that, change, color, in, response, to, certain, bacteria, and, not, others, bacteriological, plate, such, a, these, are, commonly, used, in, the, clinical, identification, of, infectious, bacterium, microbial, culture, may, also, be, used, in, the, identification, of, virus, the, medium, in, this, case, being, cell, grown, in, culture, that, the, virus, can, infect, and, then, alter, or, kill, in, the, case, of, viral, identification, a, region, of, dead, cell, result, from, viral, growth, and, is, called, a, plaque, eukaryotic, parasite, may, also, be, grown, in, culture, a, a, mean, of, identifying, a, particular, agent, in, the, absence, of, suitable, plate, culture, technique, some, microbe, require, culture, within, live, animal, bacteria, such, a, mycobacterium, leprae, and, treponema, pallidum, can, be, grown, in, animal, although, serological, and, microscopic, technique, make, the, use, of, live, animal, unnecessary, virus, are, also, usually, identified, using, alternative, to, growth, in, culture, or, animal, some, virus, may, be, grown, in, embryonated, egg, another, useful, identification, method, is, xenodiagnosis, or, the, use, of, a, vector, to, support, the, growth, of, an, infectious, agent, chaga, disease, is, the, most, significant, example, because, it, is, difficult, to, directly, demonstrate, the, presence, of, the, causative, agent, trypanosoma, cruzi, in, a, patient, which, therefore, make, it, difficult, to, definitively, make, a, diagnosis, in, this, case, xenodiagnosis, involves, the, use, of, the, vector, of, the, chaga, agent, cruzi, an, uninfected, triatomine, bug, which, take, a, blood, meal, from, a, person, suspected, of, having, been, infected, the, bug, is, later, inspected, for, growth, of, cruzi, within, it, gut, microscopy, edit, another, principal, tool, in, the, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, is, microscopy, virtually, all, of, the, culture, technique, discussed, above, rely, at, some, point, on, microscopic, examination, for, definitive, identification, of, the, infectious, agent, microscopy, may, be, carried, out, with, simple, instrument, such, a, the, compound, light, microscope, or, with, instrument, a, complex, a, an, electron, microscope, sample, obtained, from, patient, may, be, viewed, directly, under, the, light, microscope, and, can, often, rapidly, lead, to, identification, microscopy, is, often, also, used, in, conjunction, with, biochemical, staining, technique, and, can, be, made, exquisitely, specific, when, used, in, combination, with, antibody, based, technique, for, example, the, use, of, antibody, made, artificially, fluorescent, fluorescently, labeled, antibody, can, be, directed, to, bind, to, and, identify, a, specific, antigen, present, on, a, pathogen, a, fluorescence, microscope, is, then, used, to, detect, fluorescently, labeled, antibody, bound, to, internalized, antigen, within, clinical, sample, or, cultured, cell, this, technique, is, especially, useful, in, the, diagnosis, of, viral, disease, where, the, light, microscope, is, incapable, of, identifying, a, virus, directly, other, microscopic, procedure, may, also, aid, in, identifying, infectious, agent, almost, all, cell, readily, stain, with, a, number, of, basic, dye, due, to, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, negatively, charged, cellular, molecule, and, the, positive, charge, on, the, dye, a, cell, is, normally, transparent, under, a, microscope, and, using, a, stain, increase, the, contrast, of, a, cell, with, it, background, staining, a, cell, with, a, dye, such, a, giemsa, stain, or, crystal, violet, allows, a, microscopist, to, describe, it, size, shape, internal, and, external, component, and, it, association, with, other, cell, the, response, of, bacteria, to, different, staining, procedure, is, used, in, the, taxonomic, classification, of, microbe, a, well, two, method, the, gram, stain, and, the, stain, are, the, standard, approach, used, to, classify, bacteria, and, to, diagnosis, of, disease, the, gram, stain, identifies, the, bacterial, group, firmicutes, and, actinobacteria, both, of, which, contain, many, significant, human, pathogen, the, staining, procedure, identifies, the, actinobacterial, genus, mycobacterium, and, nocardia, biochemical, test, edit, biochemical, test, used, in, the, identification, of, infectious, agent, include, the, detection, of, metabolic, or, enzymatic, product, characteristic, of, a, particular, infectious, agent, since, bacteria, ferment, carbohydrate, in, pattern, characteristic, of, their, genus, and, specie, the, detection, of, fermentation, product, is, commonly, used, in, bacterial, identification, acid, alcohol, and, gas, are, usually, detected, in, these, test, when, bacteria, are, grown, in, selective, liquid, or, solid, medium, the, isolation, of, enzyme, from, infected, tissue, can, also, provide, the, basis, of, a, biochemical, diagnosis, of, an, infectious, disease, for, example, human, can, make, neither, rna, replica, nor, reverse, transcriptase, and, the, presence, of, these, enzyme, are, characteristic, of, specific, type, of, viral, infection, the, ability, of, the, viral, protein, hemagglutinin, to, bind, red, blood, cell, together, into, a, detectable, matrix, may, also, be, characterized, a, a, biochemical, test, for, viral, infection, although, strictly, speaking, hemagglutinin, is, not, an, enzyme, and, ha, no, metabolic, function, serological, method, are, highly, sensitive, specific, and, often, extremely, rapid, test, used, to, identify, microorganism, these, test, are, based, upon, the, ability, of, an, antibody, to, bind, specifically, to, an, antigen, the, antigen, usually, a, protein, or, carbohydrate, made, by, an, infectious, agent, is, bound, by, the, antibody, this, binding, then, set, off, a, chain, of, event, that, can, be, visibly, obvious, in, various, way, dependent, upon, the, test, for, example, strep, throat, is, often, diagnosed, within, minute, and, is, based, on, the, appearance, of, antigen, made, by, the, causative, agent, pyogenes, that, is, retrieved, from, a, patient, throat, with, a, cotton, swab, serological, test, if, available, are, usually, the, preferred, route, of, identification, however, the, test, are, costly, to, develop, and, the, reagent, used, in, the, test, often, require, refrigeration, some, serological, method, are, extremely, costly, although, when, commonly, used, such, a, with, the, strep, test, they, can, be, inexpensive, complex, serological, technique, have, been, developed, into, what, are, known, a, immunoassay, immunoassay, can, use, the, basic, antibody, antigen, binding, a, the, basis, to, produce, an, electro, magnetic, or, particle, radiation, signal, which, can, be, detected, by, some, form, of, instrumentation, signal, of, unknown, can, be, compared, to, that, of, standard, allowing, quantitation, of, the, target, antigen, to, aid, in, the, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, immunoassay, can, detect, or, measure, antigen, from, either, infectious, agent, or, protein, generated, by, an, infected, organism, in, response, to, a, foreign, agent, for, example, immunoassay, a, may, detect, the, presence, of, a, surface, protein, from, a, virus, particle, immunoassay, b, on, the, other, hand, may, detect, or, measure, antibody, produced, by, an, immune, system, which, are, made, to, neutralize, and, allow, the, destruction, of, the, virus, instrumentation, can, be, used, to, read, extremely, small, signal, created, by, secondary, reaction, linked, to, the, antibody, antigen, binding, instrumentation, can, control, sampling, reagent, use, reaction, time, signal, detection, calculation, of, result, and, data, management, to, yield, a, cost, effective, automated, process, for, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, molecular, diagnostics, edit, technology, based, upon, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, method, will, become, nearly, ubiquitous, gold, standard, of, diagnostics, of, the, near, future, for, several, reason, first, the, catalog, of, infectious, agent, ha, grown, to, the, point, that, virtually, all, of, the, significant, infectious, agent, of, the, human, population, have, been, identified, second, an, infectious, agent, must, grow, within, the, human, body, to, cause, disease, essentially, it, must, amplify, it, own, nucleic, acid, in, order, to, cause, a, disease, this, amplification, of, nucleic, acid, in, infected, tissue, offer, an, opportunity, to, detect, the, infectious, agent, by, using, pcr, third, the, essential, tool, for, directing, pcr, primer, are, derived, from, the, genome, of, infectious, agent, and, with, time, those, genome, will, be, known, if, they, are, not, already, thus, the, technological, ability, to, detect, any, infectious, agent, rapidly, and, specifically, are, currently, available, the, only, remaining, blockade, to, the, use, of, pcr, a, a, standard, tool, of, diagnosis, are, in, it, cost, and, application, neither, of, which, is, insurmountable, the, diagnosis, of, a, few, disease, will, not, benefit, from, the, development, of, pcr, method, such, a, some, of, the, clostridial, disease, tetanus, and, botulism, these, disease, are, fundamentally, biological, poisoning, by, relatively, small, number, of, infectious, bacteria, that, produce, extremely, potent, neurotoxin, a, significant, proliferation, of, the, infectious, agent, doe, not, occur, this, limit, the, ability, of, pcr, to, detect, the, presence, of, any, bacteria, indication, of, test, edit, there, is, usually, an, indication, for, a, specific, identification, of, an, infectious, agent, only, when, such, identification, can, aid, in, the, treatment, or, prevention, of, the, disease, or, to, advance, knowledge, of, the, course, of, an, illness, prior, to, the, development, of, effective, therapeutic, or, preventative, measure, for, example, in, the, early, prior, to, the, appearance, of, azt, for, the, treatment, of, aid, the, course, of, the, disease, wa, closely, followed, by, monitoring, the, composition, of, patient, blood, sample, even, though, the, outcome, would, not, offer, the, patient, any, further, treatment, option, in, part, these, study, on, the, appearance, of, hiv, in, specific, community, permitted, the, advancement, of, hypothesis, a, to, the, route, of, transmission, of, the, virus, by, understanding, how, the, disease, wa, transmitted, resource, could, be, targeted, to, the, community, at, greatest, risk, in, campaign, aimed, at, reducing, the, number, of, new, infection, the, specific, serological, diagnostic, identification, and, later, genotypic, or, molecular, identification, of, hiv, also, enabled, the, development, of, hypothesis, a, to, the, temporal, and, geographical, origin, of, the, virus, a, well, a, a, myriad, of, other, hypothesis, the, development, of, molecular, diagnostic, tool, have, enabled, physician, and, researcher, to, monitor, the, efficacy, of, treatment, with, drug, molecular, diagnostics, are, now, commonly, used, to, identify, hiv, in, healthy, people, long, before, the, onset, of, illness, and, have, been, used, to, demonstrate, the, existence, of, people, who, are, genetically, resistant, to, hiv, infection, thus, while, there, still, is, no, cure, for, aid, there, is, great, therapeutic, and, predictive, benefit, to, identifying, the, virus, and, monitoring, the, virus, level, within, the, blood, of, infected, individual, both, for, the, patient, and, for, the, community, at, large, prevention, edit, washing, one, hand, a, form, of, hygiene, is, an, effective, way, to, prevent, the, spread, of, infectious, disease, citation, needed, technique, like, hand, washing, wearing, gown, and, wearing, face, mask, can, help, prevent, infection, from, being, passed, from, the, surgeon, to, the, patient, or, vice, versa, frequent, hand, washing, remains, the, most, important, defense, against, the, spread, of, unwanted, organism, nutrition, must, be, improved, and, one, ha, to, make, change, in, life, such, a, avoiding, the, use, of, illicit, drug, using, a, condom, and, entering, an, exercise, program, cooking, food, well, and, avoiding, food, that, have, been, left, outside, for, a, long, time, is, also, important, antimicrobial, substance, used, to, prevent, transmission, of, infection, include, antiseptic, which, are, applied, to, living, disinfectant, which, destroy, microorganism, found, on, object, antibiotic, called, prophylactic, when, given, a, prevention, rather, a, treatment, of, infection, however, long, term, use, of, antibiotic, lead, to, resistance, and, chance, of, developing, opportunistic, infection, like, clostridium, difficile, colitis, thus, avoiding, using, antibiotic, longer, than, necessary, help, preventing, such, infectious, disease, one, of, the, way, to, prevent, or, slow, down, the, transmission, of, infectious, disease, is, to, recognize, the, different, characteristic, of, various, disease, some, critical, disease, characteristic, that, should, be, evaluated, include, virulence, distance, traveled, by, victim, and, level, of, contagiousness, the, human, strain, of, ebola, virus, for, example, incapacitate, their, victim, extremely, quickly, and, kill, them, soon, after, a, a, result, the, victim, of, this, disease, do, not, have, the, opportunity, to, travel, very, far, from, the, initial, infection, zone, also, this, virus, must, spread, through, skin, lesion, or, permeable, membrane, such, a, the, eye, thus, the, initial, stage, of, ebola, is, not, very, contagious, since, it, victim, experience, only, internal, hemorrhaging, a, a, result, of, the, above, feature, the, spread, of, ebola, is, very, rapid, and, usually, stay, within, a, relatively, confined, geographical, area, in, contrast, the, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, kill, it, victim, very, slowly, by, attacking, their, immune, system, a, a, result, many, of, it, victim, transmit, the, virus, to, other, individual, before, even, realizing, that, they, are, carrying, the, disease, also, the, relatively, low, virulence, allows, it, victim, to, travel, long, distance, increasing, the, likelihood, of, an, epidemic, another, effective, way, to, decrease, the, transmission, rate, of, infectious, disease, is, to, recognize, the, effect, of, network, in, epidemic, there, are, often, extensive, interaction, within, hub, or, group, of, infected, individual, and, other, interaction, within, discrete, hub, of, susceptible, individual, despite, the, low, interaction, between, discrete, hub, the, disease, can, jump, to, and, spread, in, a, susceptible, hub, via, a, single, or, few, interaction, with, an, infected, hub, thus, infection, rate, in, network, can, be, reduced, somewhat, if, interaction, between, individual, within, infected, hub, are, eliminated, figure, however, infection, rate, can, be, drastically, reduced, if, the, main, focus, is, on, the, prevention, of, transmission, jump, between, hub, the, use, of, needle, exchange, program, in, area, with, a, high, density, of, drug, user, with, hiv, is, an, example, of, the, successful, implementation, of, this, treatment, method, another, example, is, the, use, of, ring, culling, or, vaccination, of, potentially, susceptible, livestock, in, adjacent,

only, in, living, cell, influenza, infection, and, replication, is, a, process, first, the, virus, ha, to, bind, to, and, enter, the, cell, then, deliver, it, genome, to, a, site, where, it, can, produce, new, copy, of, viral, protein, and, rna, assemble, these, component, into, new, viral, particle, and, last, exit, the, host, cell, influenza, virus, bind, through, hemagglutinin, onto, sialic, acid, sugar, on, the, surface, of, epithelial, cell, typically, in, the, nose, throat, and, lung, of, mammal, and, intestine, of, bird, stage, in, infection, figure, after, the, hemagglutinin, is, cleaved, by, a, protease, the, cell, import, the, virus, by, endocytosis, the, intracellular, detail, are, still, being, elucidated, it, is, known, that, virion, converge, to, the, microtubule, organizing, center, interact, with, acidic, endosomes, and, finally, enter, the, target, endosomes, for, genome, release, once, inside, the, cell, the, acidic, condition, in, the, endosome, cause, two, event, to, happen, first, part, of, the, hemagglutinin, protein, fuse, the, viral, envelope, with, the, vacuole, membrane, then, the, ion, channel, allows, proton, to, move, through, the, viral, envelope, and, acidify, the, core, of, the, virus, which, cause, the, core, to, disassemble, and, release, the, viral, rna, and, core, protein, the, viral, rna, vrna, molecule, accessory, protein, and, rna, polymerase, are, then, released, into, the, cytoplasm, stage, the, ion, channel, is, blocked, by, amantadine, drug, preventing, infection, these, core, protein, and, vrna, form, a, complex, that, is, transported, into, the, cell, nucleus, where, the, rna, polymerase, begin, transcribing, complementary, vrna, step, and, b, the, vrna, either, is, exported, into, the, cytoplasm, and, translated, step, or, remains, in, the, nucleus, newly, synthesized, viral, protein, are, either, secreted, through, the, golgi, apparatus, onto, the, cell, surface, in, the, case, of, neuraminidase, and, hemagglutinin, step, or, transported, back, into, the, nucleus, to, bind, vrna, and, form, new, viral, genome, particle, step, other, viral, protein, have, multiple, action, in, the, host, cell, including, degrading, cellular, mrna, and, using, the, released, nucleotide, for, vrna, synthesis, and, also, inhibiting, translation, of, mrna, vrnas, that, form, the, genome, of, future, virus, rna, polymerase, and, other, viral, protein, are, assembled, into, a, virion, hemagglutinin, and, neuraminidase, molecule, cluster, into, a, bulge, in, the, cell, membrane, the, vrna, and, viral, core,

and, neuraminidase, with, this, membrane, coat, step, a, before, the, virus, adhere, to, the, cell, through, hemagglutinin, the, mature, virus, detach, once, their, neuraminidase, ha, cleaved, sialic, acid, residue, from, the, host, cell, after, the, release, of, new, influenza, virus, the, host, cell, dy, because, of, the, absence, of, rna, proofreading, enzyme, the, rna, polymerase, that, copy, the, viral, genome, make, an, error, roughly, every, thousand, nucleotide, which, is, the, approximate, length, of, the, influenza, vrna, hence, the, majority, of, newly, manufactured, influenza, virus, are, mutant, this, cause, antigenic, drift, which, is, a, slow, change, in, the, antigen, on, the, viral, surface, over, time, the, separation, of, the, genome, into, eight, separate, segment, of, vrna, allows, mixing, or, reassortment, of, vrnas, if, more, than, one, type, of, influenza, virus, infects, a, single, cell, the, resulting, rapid, change, in, viral, genetics, produce, antigenic, shift, which, are, sudden, change, from, one, antigen, to, another, these, sudden, large, change, allow, the, virus, to, infect, new, host, specie, and, quickly, overcome, protective, immunity, this, is, important, in, the, emergence, of, pandemic, a, discussed, below, in, the, section, on, epidemiology, mechanism, transmission, in, otherwise, healthy, adult, influenza, virus, shedding, the, time, during, which, a, person, might, be, infectious, to, another, person, increase, sharply, to, one, day, after, infection, peak, on, day, and, persists, for, an, average, total, duration, of, can, persist, a, long, a, day, in, those, who, develop, symptom, from, experimental, infection, only, of, healthy, experimentally, infected, individual, symptom, and, viral, shedding, show, a, similar, pattern, but, with, viral, shedding, preceding, illness, by, one, day, child, are, much, more, infectious, than, adult, and, shed, virus, from, just, before, they, develop, symptom, until, two, week, after, infection, in, immunocompromised, people, viral, shedding, can, continue, for, longer, than, two, week, influenza, can, be, spread, in, three, main, way, by, direct, transmission, when, an, infected, person, sneeze, mucus, directly, into, the, eye, nose, or, mouth, of, another, person, the, airborne, route, when, someone, inhales, the, aerosol, produced, by, an, infected, person, coughing, sneezing, or, spitting, and, through, or, transmission, either, from, contaminated, surface, or, from, direct, personal, contact, such, a, a, the, relative, importance, of, these, three, mode, of, transmission, is, unclear, and, they, may, all, contribute, to, the, spread, of, the, virus, in, the, airborne, route, the, droplet, that, are, small, enough, for, people, to, inhale, are, to, in, diameter, and, inhaling, just, one, droplet, might, be, enough, to, cause, an, infection, although, a, single, sneeze, release, up, to, droplet, most, of, these, droplet, are, quite, large, and, will, quickly, settle, out, of, the, air, how, long, influenza, survives, in, airborne, droplet, seems, to, be, influenced, by, the, level, of, humidity, and, uv, radiation, with, low, humidity, and, a, lack, of, sunlight, in, winter, aiding, it, survival, a, the, influenza, virus, can, persist, outside, of, the, body, it, can, also, be, transmitted, by, contaminated, surface, such, a, banknote, doorknob, light, switch, and, other, household, item, the, length, of, time, the, virus, will, persist, on, a, surface, varies, with, the, virus, surviving, for, one, to, two, day, on, hard, surface, such, a, plastic, or, metal, for, about, fifteen, minute, from, dry, paper, tissue, and, only, five, minute, on, skin, however, if, the, virus, is, present, in, mucus, this, can, protect, it, for, longer, period, up, to, day, on, banknote, avian, influenza, virus, can, survive, indefinitely, when, frozen, they, are, inactivated, by, heating, to, for, a, minimum, of, minute, a, well, a, by, acid, at, ph, pathophysiology, the, different, site, of, infection, shown, in, red, of, seasonal, versus, avian, this, influence, their, lethality, and, ability, to, spread, the, mechanism, by, which, influenza, infection, cause, symptom, in, human, have, been, studied, intensively, one, of, the, mechanism, is, believed, to, be, the, inhibition, of, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, acth, resulting, in, lowered, cortisol, level, knowing, which, gene, are, carried, by, a, particular, strain, can, help, predict, how, well, it, will, infect, human, and, how, severe, this, infection, will, be, that, is, predict, the, strain, pathophysiology, for, instance, part, of, the, process, that, allows, influenza, virus, to, invade, cell, is, the, cleavage, of, the, viral, hemagglutinin, protein, by, any, one, of, several, human, protease, in, mild, and, avirulent, virus, the, structure, of, the, hemagglutinin, mean, that, it, can, only, be, cleaved, by, protease, found, in, the, throat, and, lung, so, these, virus, can, not, infect, other, tissue, however, in, highly, virulent, strain, such, a, the, hemagglutinin, can, be, cleaved, by, a, wide, variety, of, protease, allowing, the, virus, to, spread, throughout, the, body, the, viral, hemagglutinin, protein, is, responsible, for, determining, both, which, specie, a, strain, can, infect, and, where, in, the, human, respiratory, tract, a, strain, of, influenza, will, bind, strain, that, are, easily, transmitted, between, people, have, hemagglutinin, protein, that, bind, to, receptor, in, the, upper, part, of, the, respiratory, tract, such, a, in, the, nose, throat, and, mouth, in, contrast, the, highly, lethal, strain, bind, to, receptor, that, are, mostly, found, deep, in, the, lung, this, difference, in, the, site, of, infection, may, be, part, of, the, reason, why, the, strain, cause, severe, viral, pneumonia, in, the, lung, but, is, not, easily, transmitted, by, people, coughing, and, sneezing, common, symptom, of, the, flu, such, a, fever, headache, and, fatigue, are, the, result, of, the, huge, amount, of, proinflammatory, cytokine, and, chemokines, such, a, interferon, or, tumor, necrosis, factor, produced, from, cell, in, contrast, to, the, rhinovirus, that, cause, the, common, cold, influenza, doe, cause, tissue, damage, so, symptom, are, not, entirely, due, to, the, inflammatory, response, this, massive, immune, response, might, produce, a, cytokine, storm, this, effect, ha, been, proposed, to, be, the, cause, of, the, unusual, lethality, of, both, the, avian, influenza, and, the, pandemic, strain, however, another, possibility, is, that, these, large, amount, of, cytokine, are, just, a, result, of, the, massive, level, of, viral, replication, produced, by, these, strain, and, the, immune, response, doe, not, itself, contribute, to, the, disease, prevention, vaccination, main, article, influenza, vaccine, giving, an, influenza, vaccination, the, influenza, vaccine, is, recommended, by, the, world, health, organization, and, united, state, center, for, disease, control, and, prevention, for, group, such, a, child, the, elderly, health, care, worker, and, people, who, have, chronic, illness, such, a, asthma, diabetes, heart, disease, or, are, among, others, in, healthy, adult, it, is, modestly, effective, in, decreasing, the, amount, of, symptom, in, a, population, evidence, is, supportive, of, a, decreased, rate, of, influenza, in, child, over, the, age, of, two, in, those, with, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, vaccination, reduces, exacerbation, it, is, not, clear, if, it, reduces, asthma, exacerbation, evidence, support, a, lower, rate, of, illness, in, many, group, who, are, immunocompromised, such, a, those, with, cancer, and, post, organ, transplant, in, those, at, high, risk, immunization, may, reduce, the, risk, of, heart, disease, whether, immunizing, health, care, worker, effect, patient, outcome, is, controversial, with, some, review, finding, insufficient, evidence, and, others, finding, tentative, evidence, due, to, the, high, mutation, rate, of, the, virus, a, particular, influenza, vaccine, usually, confers, protection, for, no, more, than, a, few, year, every, year, the, world, health, organization, predicts, which, strain, of, the, virus, are, most, likely, to, be, circulating, in, the, next, year, see, historical, annual, reformulations, of, the, influenza, vaccine, allowing, pharmaceutical, company, to, develop, vaccine, that, will, provide, the, best, immunity, against, these, strain, the, vaccine, is, reformulated, each, season, for, a, few, specific, flu, strain, but, doe, not, include, all, the, strain, active, in, the, world, during, that, season, it, take, about, six, month, for, the, manufacturer, to, formulate, and, produce, the, million, of, dos, required, to, deal, with, the, seasonal, epidemic, occasionally, a, new, or, overlooked, strain, becomes, prominent, during, that, time, it, is, also, possible, to, get, infected, just, before, vaccination, and, get, sick, with, the, strain, that, the, vaccine, is, supposed, to, prevent, a, the, vaccine, take, about, two, week, to, become, effective, vaccine, can, cause, the, immune, system, to, react, a, if, the, body, were, actually, being, infected, and, general, infection, symptom, many, cold, and, flu, symptom, are, just, general, infection, symptom, can, appear, though, these, symptom, are, usually, not, a, severe, or, a, influenza, the, most, dangerous, adverse, effect, is, a, severe, allergic, reaction, to, either, the, virus, material, itself, or, residue, from, the, hen, egg, used, to, grow, the, influenza, however, these, reaction, are, extremely, rare, the, of, seasonal, influenza, vaccination, ha, been, widely, evaluated, for, different, group, and, in, different, setting, it, ha, generally, been, found, to, be, a, intervention, especially, in, child, and, the, elderly, however, the, result, of, economic, evaluation, of, influenza, vaccination, have, often, been, found, to, be, dependent, on, key, assumption, infection, control, further, information, influenza, prevention, reasonably, effective, way, to, reduce, the, transmission, of, influenza, include, good, personal, health, and, hygiene, habit, such, a, not, touching, your, eye, nose, or, mouth, frequent, hand, washing, with, soap, and, water, or, with, hand, rub, covering, cough, and, sneeze, avoiding, close, contact, with, sick, people, and, staying, home, yourself, if, you, are, sick, avoiding, spitting, is, also, recommended, although, face, mask, might, help, prevent, transmission, when, caring, for, the, sick, there, is, mixed, evidence, on, beneficial, effect, in, the, community, smoking, raise, the, risk, of, contracting, influenza, a, well, a, producing, more, severe, disease, symptom, since, influenza, spread, through, both, aerosol, and, contact, with, contaminated, surface, surface, sanitizing, may, help, prevent, some, infection, alcohol, is, an, effective, sanitizer, against, influenza, virus, while, quaternary, ammonium, compound, can, be, used, with, alcohol, so, that, the, sanitizing, effect, last, for, longer, in, hospital, quaternary, ammonium, compound, and, bleach, are, used, to, sanitize, room, or, equipment, that, have, been, occupied, by, patient, with, influenza, symptom, at, home, this, can, be, done, effectively, with, a, diluted, chlorine, bleach, during, past, pandemic, closing, school, church, and, theater, slowed, the, spread, of, the, virus, but, did, not, have, a, large, effect, on, the, overall, death, rate, it, is, uncertain, if, reducing, public, gathering, by, for, example, closing, school, and, workplace, will, reduce, transmission, since, people, with, influenza, may, just, be, moved, from, one, area, to, another, such, measure, would, also, be, difficult, to, enforce, and, might, be, unpopular, when, small, number, of, people, are, infected, isolating, the, sick, might, reduce, the, risk, of, transmission, treatment, main, article, influenza, treatment, people, with, the, flu, are, advised, to, get, plenty, of, rest, drink, plenty, of, liquid, avoid, using, alcohol, and, tobacco, and, if, necessary, take, medication, such, a, acetaminophen, paracetamol, to, relieve, the, fever, and, muscle, ache, associated, with, the, flu, child, and, teenager, with, flu, symptom, particularly, fever, should, avoid, taking, aspirin, during, an, influenza, infection, especially, influenza, type, b, because, doing, so, can, lead, to, reye, syndrome, a, rare, but, potentially, fatal, disease, of, the, liver, since, influenza, is, caused, by, a, virus, antibiotic, have, no, effect, on, the, infection, unless, prescribed, for, secondary, infection, such, a, bacterial, pneumonia, antiviral, medication, may, be, effective, but, some, strain, of, influenza, can, show, resistance, to, the, standard, antiviral, drug, and, there, is, concern, about, the, quality, of, the, research, antiviral, the, two, class, of, antiviral, drug, used, against, influenza, are, neuraminidase, inhibitor, oseltamivir, and, zanamivir, and, protein, inhibitor, adamantane, derivative, neuraminidase, inhibitor, overall, the, benefit, of, neuraminidase, inhibitor, in, those, who, are, otherwise, healthy, do, not, appear, to, be, greater, than, the, risk, there, doe, not, appear, to, be, any, benefit, in, those, with, other, health, problem, in, those, believed, to, have, the, flu, they, decreased, the, length, of, time, symptom, were, present, by, slightly, le, than, a, day, but, did, not, appear, to, affect, the, risk, of, complication, such, a, needing, hospitalization, or, pneumonia, previous, to, the, benefit, were, unclear, a, the, manufacturer, roche, refused, to, release, trial, data, for, independent, analysis, inhibitor, the, antiviral, drug, amantadine, and, rimantadine, inhibit, a, viral, ion, channel, protein, thus, inhibiting, replication, of, the, influenza, a, virus, these, drug, are, sometimes, effective, against, influenza, a, if, given, early, in, the, infection, but, are, ineffective, against, influenza, b, virus, which, lack, the, drug, target, measured, resistance, to, amantadine, and, rimantadine, in, american, isolates, of, ha, increased, to, in, this, high, level, of, resistance, may, be, due, to, the, easy, availability, of, amantadines, a, part, of, cold, remedy, in, country, such, a, china, and, russia, and, their, use, to, prevent, outbreak, of, influenza, in, farmed, poultry, the, cdc, recommended, against, using, inhibitor, during, the, influenza, season, due, to, high, level, of, drug, resistance, prognosis, influenza, effect, are, much, more, severe, and, last, longer, than, those, of, the, common, cold, most, people, will, recover, completely, in, about, one, to, two, week, but, others, will, develop, complication, such, a, pneumonia, thus, influenza, can, be, deadly, especially, for, the, weak, young, and, old, or, chronically, people, with, a, weak, immune, system, such, a, people, with, advanced, hiv, infection, or, transplant, patient, whose, immune, system, are, medically, suppressed, to, prevent, transplant, organ, rejection, suffer, from, particularly, severe, disease, pregnant, woman, and, young, child, are, also, at, a, high, risk, for, complication, the, flu, can, worsen, chronic, health, problem, people, with, emphysema, chronic, bronchitis, or, asthma, may, experience, shortness, of, breath, while, they, have, the, flu, and, influenza, may, cause, worsening, of, coronary, heart, disease, or, congestive, heart, failure, smoking, is, another, risk, factor, associated, with, more, serious, disease, and, increased, mortality, from, influenza, according, to, the, world, health, organization, every, winter, ten, of, million, of, people, get, the, flu, most, are, only, ill, and, out, of, work, for, a, week, yet, the, elderly, are, at, a, higher, risk, of, death, from, the, illness, we, know, the, worldwide, death, toll, exceeds, a, few, hundred, thousand, people, a, year, but, even, in, developed, country, the, number, are, uncertain, because, medical, authority, do, usually, verify, who, actually, died, of, influenza, and, who, died, of, a, illness, even, healthy, people, can, be, affected, and, serious, problem, from, influenza, can, happen, at, any, age, people, over, year, old, very, young, child, and, people, of, any, age, with, chronic, medical, condition, are, more, likely, to, get, complication, from, influenza, such, a, pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus, and, ear, infection, in, some, case, an, autoimmune, response, to, an, influenza, infection, may, contribute, to, the, development, of, syndrome, however, a, many, other, infection, can, increase, the, risk, of, this, disease, influenza, may, only, be, an, important, cause, during, epidemic, this, syndrome, ha, been, believed, to, also, be, a, rare, side, effect, of, influenza, vaccine, one, review, give, an, incidence, of, about, one, case, per, million, vaccination, getting, infected, by, influenza, itself, increase, both, the, risk, of, death, up, to, in, and, increase, the, risk, of, developing, gb, to, a, much, higher, level, than, the, highest, level, of, suspected, vaccine, involvement, approx, time, higher, by, recent, estimate, epidemiology, seasonal, variation, further, information, flu, season, seasonal, risk, area, for, influenza, blue, red, and, yellow, influenza, reach, peak, prevalence, in, winter, and, because, the, northern, and, southern, hemisphere, have, winter, at, different, time, of, the, year, there, are, actually, two, different, flu, season, each, year, this, is, why, the, world, health, organization, assisted, by, the, national, influenza, center, make, recommendation, for, two, different, vaccine, formulation, every, year, one, for, the, northern, and, one, for, the, southern, hemisphere, a, puzzle, ha, been, why, outbreak, of, the, flu, occur, seasonally, rather, than, uniformly, throughout, the, year, one, possible, explanation, is, that, because, people, are, indoors, more, often, during, the, winter, they, are, in, close, contact, more, often, and, this, promotes, transmission, from, person, to, person, increased, travel, due, to, the, northern, hemisphere, winter, holiday, season, may, also, play, a, role, another, factor, is, that, cold, temperature, lead, to, drier, air, which, may, dehydrate, mucus, preventing, the, body, from, effectively, expelling, virus, particle, the, virus, also, survives, longer, on, surface, at, colder, temperature, and, aerosol, transmission, of, the, virus, is, highest, in, cold, environment, le, than, with, low, relative, humidity, indeed, the, lower, air, humidity, in, winter, seems, to, be, the, main, cause, of, seasonal, influenza, transmission, in, temperate, region, however, seasonal, change, in, infection, rate, also, occur, in, tropical, region, and, in, some, country, these, peak, of, infection, are, seen, mainly, during, the, rainy, season, seasonal, change, in, contact, rate, from, school, term, which, are, a, major, factor, in, other, childhood, disease, such, a, measles, and, pertussis, may, also, play, a, role, in, the, flu, a, combination, of, these, small, seasonal, effect, may, be, amplified, by, dynamical, resonance, with, the, endogenous, disease, cycle, exhibit, seasonality, in, both, human, and, bird, an, alternative, hypothesis, to, explain, seasonality, in, influenza, infection, is, an, effect, of, vitamin, d, level, on, immunity, to, the, virus, this, idea, wa, first, proposed, by, robert, edgar, in, he, proposed, that, the, cause, of, influenza, epidemic, during, winter, may, be, connected, to, seasonal, fluctuation, of, vitamin, d, which, is, produced, in, the, skin, under, the, influence, of, solar, or, artificial, uv, radiation, this, could, explain, why, influenza, occurs, mostly, in, winter, and, during, the, tropical, rainy, season, when, people, stay, indoors, away, from, the, sun, and, their, vitamin, d, level, fall, epidemic, and, pandemic, spread, further, information, flu, pandemic, antigenic, drift, creates, influenza, virus, with, slightly, modified, antigen, while, antigenic, shift, generates, virus, with, entirely, novel, antigen, a, influenza, is, caused, by, a, variety, of, specie, and, strain, of, virus, in, any, given, year, some, strain, can, die, out, while, others, create, epidemic, while, yet, another, strain, can, cause, a, pandemic, typically, in, a, year, normal, two, flu, season, one, per, hemisphere, there, are, between, three, and, five, million, case, of, severe, illness, and, around, death, worldwide, which, by, some, definition, is, a, yearly, influenza, epidemic, although, the, incidence, of, influenza, can, vary, widely, between, year, approximately, death, and, more, than, hospitalization, are, directly, associated, with, influenza, every, year, in, the, united, state, on, average, people, died, each, year, in, the, united, state, between, and, from, influenza, in, the, center, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, in, the, united, state, changed, the, way, it, report, the, year, estimate, for, death, now, they, are, reported, a, a, range, from, a, low, of, about, death, to, a, high, of, per, year, roughly, three, time, per, century, a, pandemic, occurs, which, infects, a, large, proportion, of, the, world, population, and, can, kill, ten, of, million, of, people, see, pandemic, section, one, study, estimated, that, if, a, strain, with, similar, virulence, to, the, influenza, emerged, today, it, could, kill, between, and, million, people, antigenic, shift, or, reassortment, can, result, in, novel, and, highly, pathogenic, strain, of, human, influenza, new, influenza, virus, are, constantly, evolving, by, mutation, or, by, reassortment, mutation, can, cause, small, change, in, the, hemagglutinin, and, neuraminidase, antigen, on, the, surface, of, the, virus, this, is, called, antigenic, drift, which, slowly, creates, an, increasing, variety, of, strain, until, one, evolves, that, can, infect, people, who, are, immune, to, the, strain, this, new, variant, then, replaces, the, older, strain, a, it, rapidly, sweep, through, the, human, population, often, causing, an, epidemic, however, since, the, strain, produced, by, drift, will, still, be, reasonably, similar, to, the, older, strain, some, people, will, still, be, immune, to, them, in, contrast, when, influenza, virus, reassort, they, acquire, completely, new, example, by, reassortment, between, avian, strain, and, human, strain, this, is, called, antigenic, shift, if, a, human, influenza, virus, is, produced, that, ha, entirely, new, antigen, everybody, will, be, susceptible, and, the, novel, influenza, will, spread, uncontrollably, causing, a, pandemic, in, contrast, to, this, model, of, pandemic, based, on, antigenic, drift, and, shift, an, alternative, approach, ha, been, proposed, where, the, periodic, pandemic, are, produced, by, interaction, of, a, fixed, set, of, viral, strain, with, a, human, population, with, a, constantly, changing, set, of, immunity, to, different, viral, strain, the, generation, time, for, influenza, the, time, from, one, infection, to, the, next, is, very, short, only, day, this, explains, why, influenza, epidemic, start, and, finish, in, a, short, time, scale, of, only, a, few, month, from, a, public, health, point, of, view, flu, epidemic, spread, rapidly, and, are, very, difficult, to, control, most, influenza, virus, strain, are, not, very, infectious, and, each, infected, individual, will, only, go, on, to, infect, one, or, two, other, individual, the, basic, reproduction, number, for, influenza, is, generally, around, however, the, generation, time, for, influenza, is, extremely, short, the, time, from, a, person, becoming, infected, to, when, he, infects, the, next, person, is, only, two, day, the, short, generation, time, mean, that, influenza, epidemic, generally, peak, at, around, month, and, burn, out, after, month, the, decision, to, intervene, in, an, influenza, epidemic, therefore, ha, to, be, taken, early, and, the, decision, is, therefore, often, made, on, the, back, of, incomplete, data, another, problem, is, that, individual, become, infectious, before, they, become, symptomatic, which, mean, that, putting, people, in, quarantine, after, they, become, ill, is, not, an, effective, public, health, intervention, for, the, average, person, viral, shedding, tends, to, peak, on, day, two, whereas, symptom, peak, on, day, three, history, etymology, the, word, influenza, come, from, the, italian, language, meaning, influence, and, refers, to, the, cause, of, the, disease, initially, this, ascribed, illness, to, unfavorable, astrological, influence, change, in, medical, thought, led, to, it, modification, to, influenza, del, freddo, meaning, influence, of, the, cold, the, word, influenza, wa, first, used, in, english, to, refer, to, the, disease, we, know, today, in, by, hugger, of, the, university, of, edinburgh, in, his, thesis, de, catarrho, epidemio, vel, influenza, prout, in, india, occidentali, sese, ostendit, archaic, term, for, influenza, include, epidemic, catarrh, grippe, from, the, french, first, used, by, molyneaux, in, sweating, sickness, and, spanish, fever,

of, swine, flu, the, symptom, of, human, influenza, were, clearly, described, by, hippocrates, roughly, year, ago, although, the, virus, seems, to, have, caused, epidemic, throughout, human, history, historical, data, on, influenza, are, difficult, to, interpret, because, the, symptom, can, be, similar, to, those, of, other, respiratory, disease, the, disease, may, have, spread, from, europe, to, the, america, a, early, a, the, european, colonization, of, the, america, since, almost, the, entire, indigenous, population, of, the, antilles, wa, killed, by, an, epidemic, resembling, influenza, that, broke, out, in, after, the, arrival, of, christopher, columbus, the, first, convincing, record, of, an, influenza, pandemic, wa, of, an, outbreak, in, which, began, in, russia, and, spread, to, europe, via, africa, in, rome, over, people, were, killed, and, several, spanish, city, were, almost, wiped, out, pandemic, continued, sporadically, throughout, the, and, century, with, the, pandemic, of, being, particularly, widespread, it, infected, approximately, a, quarter, of, the, people, exposed, the, most, famous, and, lethal, outbreak, wa, the, flu, pandemic, spanish, flu, pandemic, type, a, influenza, subtype, which, lasted, from, to, it, is, not, known, exactly, how, many, it, killed, but, estimate, range, from, to, million, people, this, pandemic, ha, been, described, a, the, greatest, medical, holocaust, in, history, and, may, have, killed, a, many, people, a, the, black, death, this, huge, death, toll, wa, caused, by, an, extremely, high, infection, rate, of, up, to,

pacific, island, the, unusually, severe, disease, killed, between, and, of, those, infected, a, opposed, to, the, more, usual, flu, epidemic, mortality, rate, of, another, unusual, feature, of, this, pandemic, wa, that, it, mostly, killed, young, adult, with, of, pandemic, influenza, death, occurring, in, people, under, and, more, than, half, in, young, adult, to, year, old, this, is, unusual, since, influenza, is, normally, most, deadly, to, the, very, young, under, age, and, the, very, old, over, age, the, total, mortality, of, the, pandemic, is, not, known, but, it, is, estimated, that, to, of, the, world, population, wa, killed, a, many, a, million, may, have, been, killed, in, the, first, week, in, contrast, ha, killed, million, in, it, first, year, later, flu, pandemic, were, not, so, devastating, they, included, the, asian, flu, type, a, strain, and, the, hong, kong, flu, type, a, strain, but, even, these, smaller, outbreak, killed, million, of, people, in, later, pandemic,

chemist, beginning, at, the, normale, and, continuing, at, strasbourg, and, lille, he, examined, the, chemical, optical, and, crystallographic, property, of, a, group, of, compound, known, a, tartrate, he, resolved, a, problem, concerning, the, nature, of, tartaric, acid, a, solution, of, this, compound, derived, from, living, thing, specifically, wine, lee, rotated, the, plane, of, polarization, of, light, passing, through, it, the, mystery, wa, that, tartaric, acid, derived, by, chemical, synthesis, had, no, such, effect, even, though, it, chemical, reaction, were, identical, and, it, elemental, composition, wa, the, same, pasteur, wa, able, to, show, not, only, that, optical, activity, related, to, the, shape, of, the, crystal, but, also, that, an, asymmetric, internal, arrangement, of, the, molecule, of, the, compound, wa, responsible, for, twisting, the, light, the, and, tartrate, were, isometric, mirror, image, of, each, other, this, wa, the, first, time, anyone, had, demonstrated, molecular, chirality, and, also, the, first, explanation, of, isomerism, some, historian, consider, pasteur, work, in, this, area, to, be, his, most, profound, and, most, original, contribution, to, science, and, his, greatest, scientific, discovery, fermentation, and, germ, theory, of, disease, pasteur, demonstrated, that, fermentation, is, caused, by, the, growth, of, and, the, emergent, growth, of, bacteria, in, nutrient, broth, is, due, not, to, spontaneous, generation, but, rather, to, biogenesis, omne, vivum, ex, vivo, all, life, from, life, he, wa, motivated, to, investigate, the, matter, while, working, at, lille, in, a, local, wine, manufacturer, bigot, the, father, of, his, student, sought, for, his, advice, on, the, problem, of, making, beetroot, alcohol, and, souring, after, long, storage, in, he, developed, his, idea, stating, that, i, intend, to, establish, that, just, a, there, is, an, alcoholic, ferment, the, yeast, of, beer, which, is, found, everywhere, that, sugar, is, decomposed, into, alcohol, and, carbonic, acid, so, also, there, is, a, particular, ferment, a, lactic, yeast, always, present, when, sugar, becomes, lactic, acid, according, to, his, pasteur, presented, his, experiment, on, sour, milk, titled, latate, fermentation, in, august, before, the, de, science, de, lille, but, according, to, a, memoire, subsequently, published, it, wa, dated, november, it, wa, published, in, full, form, in, he, demonstrated, that, yeast, wa, responsible, for, fermentation, to, produce, alcohol, from, sugar, and, that, air, oxygen, wa, not, required, he, also, demonstrated, that, fermentation, could, also, produce, lactic, acid, due, to, bacterial, contamination, which, make, wine, sour, this, is, regarded, a, the, foundation, of, pasteur, fermentation, experiment, and, disprove, of, spontaneous, generation, of, life, pasteur, experimenting, in, his, laboratory, institut, pasteur, de, lille, pasteur, research, also, showed, that, the, growth, of, wa, responsible, for, spoiling, beverage, such, a, beer, wine, and, milk, with, this, established, he, invented, a, process, in, which, liquid, such, a, milk, were, heated, to, a, temperature, between, and, this, killed, most, bacteria, and, mould, already, present, within, them, pasteur, and, claude, bernard, completed, the, first, test, on, april, pasteur, patented, the, process, to, fight, the, disease, of, wine, in, the, method, became, known, a, pasteurization, and, wa, soon, applied, to, beer, and, milk, beverage, contamination, led, pasteur, to, the, idea, that, infecting, animal, and, human, cause, disease, he, proposed, preventing, the, entry, of, into, the, human, body, leading, joseph, lister, to, develop, antiseptic, method, in, surgery, lister, work, in, turn, inspired, joseph, lawrence, to, develop, his, own, antiseptic, which, he, named, in, tribute, listerine, in, two, parasitic, disease, called, and, flacherie, were, killing, great, number, of, silkworm, at, alais, now, pasteur, worked, several, year, proving, that, these, disease, were, caused, by, a, microbe, attacking, silkworm, egg, and, that, eliminating, the, microbe, in, silkworm, nursery, would, eradicate, the, disease, pasteur, also, discovered, anaerobiosis, whereby, some, can, develop, and, live, without, air, or, oxygen, called, the, pasteur, effect, spontaneous, generation, bottle, en, col, de, cygne, swan, neck, duct, used, by, pasteur, louis, pasteurization, experiment, illustrates, the, fact, that, the, spoilage, of, liquid, wa, caused, by, particle, in, the, air, rather, than, the, air, itself, these, experiment, were, important, piece, of, evidence, supporting, the, idea, of, germ, theory, of, disease, following, his, fermentation, experiment, pasteur, demonstrated, that, the, skin, of, grape, wa, the, natural, source, of, yeast, and, that, sterilized, grape, and, grape, juice, never, fermented, he, drew, grape, juice, from, under, the, skin, with, sterilzed, needle, and, also, covered, grape, with, sterilized, cloth, both, experiment, could, not, produce, wine, in, sterilized, container, his, finding, and, idea, were, against, the, prevailing, notion, of, spontaneous, generation, he, received, a, particularly, stern, criticism, from, pouchet, who, wa, director, of, the, rouen, museum, of, natural, history, to, settle, the, debate, between, the, eminent, scientist, the, french, academy, of, science, offered, alhumbert, prize, carrying, franc, to, who, ever, could, experimentally, demonstrate, for, or, against, the, doctrine, to, prove, himself, correct, pasteur, exposed, boiled, broth, to, air, in, flask, that, contained, a, filter, to, prevent, all, particle, from, passing, through, to, the, growth, medium, and, even, in, flask, with, no, filter, at, all, with, air, being, admitted, via, a, long, tortuous, tube, that, would, not, allow, dust, particle, to, pas, nothing, grew, in, the, broth, unless, the,

wa, one, of, the, last, and, most, important, experiment, disproving, the, theory, of, spontaneous, generation, for, which, pasteur, won, the, alhumbert, prize, in, he, concluded, that, never, will, the, doctrine, of, spontaneous, generation, recover, from, the, mortal, blow, of, this, simple, experiment, there, is, no, known, circumstance, in, which, it, can, be, confirmed, that, microscopic, being, came, into, the, world, without, germ, without, parent, similar, to, themselves, immunology, and, vaccination, pasteur, later, work, on, disease, included, work, on, chicken, cholera, during, this, work, a, culture, of, the, responsible, bacteria, had, spoiled, and, failed, to, induce, the, disease, in, some, chicken, he, wa, infecting, with, the, disease, upon, reusing, these, healthy, chicken, pasteur, discovered, he, could, not, infect, them, even, with, fresh, bacteria, the, weakened, bacteria, had, caused, the, chicken, to, become, immune, to, the, disease, though, they, had, caused, only, mild, symptom, his, assistant, charles, chamberland, of, french, origin, had, been, instructed, to, inoculate, the, chicken, after, pasteur, went, on, holiday, chamberland, failed, to, do, this, but, instead, went, on, holiday, himself, on, his, return, the, culture, made, the, chicken, unwell, but, instead, of, the, infection, being, fatal, a, they, usually, were, the, chicken, recovered, completely, chamberland, assumed, an, error, had, been, made, and, wanted, to, discard, the, apparently, faulty, culture, when, pasteur, stopped, him, pasteur, guessed, the, recovered, animal, now, might, be, immune, to, the, disease, a, were, the, animal, at, that, had, recovered, from, anthrax, in, the, he, applied, this, immunization, method, to, anthrax, which, affected, cattle, and, aroused, interest, in, combating, other, disease, louis, pasteur, in, his, laboratory, painting, by, edelfeldt, in, pasteur, publicly, claimed, he, had, made, the, anthrax, vaccine, by, exposing, the, bacillus, to, oxygen, his, laboratory, notebook, now, in, the, nationale, in, paris, in, fact, show, that, he, used, the, method, of, rival, toussaint, a, toulouse, veterinary, surgeon, to, create, the, anthrax, vaccine, this, method, used, the, oxidizing, agent, potassium, dichromate, pasteur, oxygen, method, did, eventually, produce, a, vaccine, but, only, after, he, had, been, awarded, a, patent, on, the, production, of, an, anthrax, vaccine, the, notion, of, a, weak, form, of, a, disease, causing, immunity, to, the, virulent, version, wa, not, new, this, had, been, known, for, a, long, time, for, smallpox, inoculation, with, smallpox, variolation, wa, known, to, result, in, far, le, scarring, and, greatly, reduced, mortality, in, comparison, with, the, naturally, acquired, disease, edward, jenner, had, also, discovered, vaccination, using, cowpox, vaccinia, to, give, to, smallpox, in, and, by, pasteur, time, this, had, generally, replaced, the, use, of, actual, smallpox, variola, material, in, inoculation, the, difference, between, smallpox, vaccination, and, anthrax, or, chicken, cholera, vaccination, wa, that, the, weakened, form, of, the, latter, two, disease, organism, had, been, generated, artificially, so, a, naturally, weak, form, of, the, disease, organism, did, not, need, to, be, found, this, discovery, revolutionized, work, in, infectious, disease, and, pasteur, gave, these, artificially, weakened, disease, the, generic, name, of, vaccine, in, honour, of, jenner, discovery, pasteur, produced, the, first, vaccine, for, rabies, by, growing, the, virus, in, rabbit, and, then, weakening, it, by, drying, the, affected, nerve, tissue, the, rabies, vaccine, wa, initially, created, by, emile, roux, a, french, doctor, and, a, colleague, of, pasteur, who, had, been, working, with, a, killed, vaccine, produced, by, desiccating, the, spinal, cord, of, infected, rabbit, the, vaccine, had, been, tested, in, dog, before, it, first, human, trial, this, vaccine, wa, first, used, on, old, joseph, meister, on, july, after, the, boy, wa, badly, mauled, by, a, rabid, dog, this, wa, done, at, some, personal, risk, for, pasteur, since, he, wa, not, a, licensed, physician, and, could, have, faced, prosecution, for, treating, the, boy, after, consulting, with, colleague, he, decided, to, go, ahead, with, the, treatment, three, month, later, he, examined, meister, and, found, that, he, wa, in, good, health, pasteur, wa, hailed, a, a, hero, and, the, legal, matter, wa, not, pursued, the, treatment, success, laid, the, foundation, for, the, manufacture, of, many, other, vaccine, the, first, of, the, pasteur, institute, wa, also, built, on, the, basis, of, this, achievement, legal, risk, wa, not, the, only, kind, pasteur, undertook, in, the, story, of, san, michele, axel, munthe, writes, of, the, rabies, vaccine, research, pasteur, himself, wa, absolutely, fearless, anxious, to, secure, a, sample, of, saliva,

his, the, private, science, of, louis, pasteur, and, declared, that, pasteur, had, given, several, misleading, account, and, played, deception, in, his, most, important, discovery, max, perutz, published, a, defense, of, pasteur, in, the, new, york, review, of, book, based, on, further, examination, of, pasteur, document, french, immnunologist, patrice, concluded, in, his, book, louis, pasteur, that, in, spite, of, his, genius, pasteur, wa, sometimes, unfair, combative, arrogant, unattractive, in, attitude, inflexible, and, even, dogmatic, fermentation, when, pasteur, published, his, theory, and, experiment, on, fermentation, in, it, wa, not, new, to, science, neither, the, idea, nor, the, experiment, in, a, german, chemist, justus, von, liebig, had, noted, that, yeast, could, induce, fermentation, in, water, however, he, did, not, know, that, yeast, were, organism, in, another, german, ludersdorrf, reported, that, yeast, were, microorganism, that, convert, sugar, into, alcohol, in, antoine, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, university, of, montpellier, showed, that, sugar, wa, converted, to, sucrose, and, fructose, in, a, closed, bottle, containing, water, and, when, he, added, calcium, or, zinc, chloride, to, it, no, reaction, occurred, he, also, noticed, mould, developing, in, the, solution, but, could, not, fathom, the, significance, of, it, he, concluded, that, water, wa, the, factor, for, fermentation, he, changed, his, conclusion, in, that, water, wa, not, the, main, factor, in, fact, fermentation, wa, directly, related, to, the, growth, of, mould, and, mould, required, air, for, growth, he, regarded, himself, a, the, first, to, show, the, role, of, microorganism, in, fermentation, pasteur, started, his, experiment, only, in, and, published, his, finding, in, april, issue, of, comptes, rendus, chimie, paper, appeared, in, january, issue, which, a, noted, did, not, bring, any, novel, idea, or, experiment, that, earlier, work, had, not, shown, on, the, other, hand, wa, probably, aware, of, pasteur, preliminary, work, with, both, scientist, claiming, priority, on, the, discovery, a, bitter, and, protracted, dispute, lasted, throughout, their, life, their, rivalry, extended, to, idea, on, microbiology, pathogenesis, and, germ, theory, particularly, on, the, spontaneous, generation, because, pasteur, in, his, paper, explicitly, stated, that, the, lactic, acid, bacteria, he, named, them, lactic, yeast, which, caused, wine, souring, take, birth, spontaneously, a, easily, a, beer, yeast, every, time, that, the, condition, are, favourable, this, statement, directly, implied, that, pasteur, did, believe, in, spontaneous, generation, he, condemned, the, idea, of, pasteur, a, greatest, scientific, silliness, of, the, age, however, wa, on, the, losing, side, a, the, bmj, obituary, remarked, his, name, wa, associated, with, bygone, controversy, a, to, priority, which, it, would, be, unprofitable, to, recall, pasteur, and, believed, that, fermentation, wa, exclusively, cellular, activity, that, is, it, wa, only, due, to, living, cell, but, later, extraction, of, enzyme, such, a, invertase, by, marcelin, barthelot, in, showed, that, it, wa, simply, an, enzymatic, reaction, anthrax, vaccine, pasteur, had, given, a, misleading, account, of, the, preparation, of, the, anthrax, vaccine, used, in, the, experiment, at, the, fact, is, that, pasteur, publicly, claimed, his, success, in, developing, anthrax, vaccine, in, however, his, toussaint, wa, the, one, who, developed, the, first, vaccine, toussaint, isolated, the, bacteria, cholera, de, poules, later, named, to, add, irony, pasteurella, in, honour, of, pasteur, in, and, gave, sample, to, pasteur, who, used, for, his, own, work, in, with, his, publishing, on, july, at, the, french, academy, of, science, toussaint, presented, his, successful, result, with, an, attenuated, vaccine, against, anthrax, in, dog, and, sheep, pasteur, purely, on, ground, of, jealousy, contested, the, discovery, by, publicly, displaying, his, vaccination, method, in, on, may, the, promotional, experiment, wa, a, success, and, helped, pasteur, sell, his, product, getting, all, the, benefit, and, glory, experimental, ethic, pasteur, experiment, are, often, cited, a, against, medical, ethic, especially, on, his, vaccination, of, meister, firstly, he, did, not, have, any, experience, in, medical, practice, and, more, importantly, a, medical, license, this, is, often, cited, a, a, serious, threat, to, his, professional, and, personal, reputation, even, his, closest, partner, emile, roux, refused, to, participate, in, the, unjust, clinical, trial, but, pasteur, executed, vaccination, of, the, boy, under, the, close, watch, of, practising, physician, grancher, head, of, the, paediatric, clinic, at, paris, child, hospital, he, wa, even, not, allowed, to, hold, the, syringe, although, the, inoculation, were, entirely, under,

death, is, almost, certain, even, today, secondly, he, kept, secrecy, of, his, procedure, and, did, not, give, proper, trial, but, these, accusation, were, not, entirely, correct, he, disclosed, his,

continue, taking, them, for, four, week, after, leaving, except, for, which, only, need, to, be, started, two, day, before, and, continued, for, seven, day, afterward, the, use, of, preventative, drug, is, often, not, practical, for, those, who, live, in, area, where, malaria, exists, and, their, use, is, usually, only, in, visitor, and, traveller, this, is, due, to, the, cost, of, the, drug, side, effect, from, use, and, the, difficulty, in, obtaining, drug, outside, of, wealthy, nation, the, use, of, preventative, drug, where, mosquito, are, present, may, encourage, the, development, of, partial, resistance, an, exception, to, this, is, during, pregnancy, when, taking, medication, to, prevent, malaria, ha, been, found, to, improve, the, weight, of, the, baby, at, birth, and, decrease, the, risk, of, anemia, in, the, mother, treatment, malaria, is, treated, with, antimalarial, medication, the, one, used, depends, on, the, type, and, severity, of, the, disease, while, medication, against, fever, are, commonly, used, their, effect, on, outcome, are, not, clear, uncomplicated, malaria, may, be, treated, with, oral, medication, the, most, effective, treatment, for, falciparum,

working, in, the, presidency, general, hospital, in, calcutta, proved, the, complete, of, the, malaria, parasite, in, mosquito, he, thus, proved, that, the, mosquito, wa, the, vector, for, malaria, in, human, by, showing, that, certain, mosquito, specie, transmit, malaria, to, bird, he, isolated, malaria, parasite, from, the, salivary, gland, of, mosquito, that, had, fed, on, infected, bird, for, this, work, ross, received, the, nobel, prize, in, medicine, after, resigning, from, the, indian, medical, service, ross, worked, at, the, newly, established, liverpool, school, of, tropical, medicine, and, directed, effort, in, egypt, panama, greece, and, mauritius, the, finding, of, finlay, and, ross, were, later, confirmed, by, a, medical, board, headed, by, walter, reed, in, it, recommendation, were, implemented, by, william, gorgas, in, the, health, measure, undertaken, during, construction, of, the, panama, canal, this, work, saved, the, life, of, thousand, of, worker, and, helped, develop, the, method, used, in, future, campaign, against, the, disease, the, first, effective, treatment, for, malaria, came, from, the, bark, of, cinchona, tree, which, contains, quinine, this, tree, grows, on, the, slope, of, the, andes, mainly, in, peru, the, indigenous, people, of, peru, made, a, tincture, of, cinchona, to, control, fever, it, effectiveness, against, malaria, wa, found, and, the, jesuit, introduced, the, treatment, to, europe, around, by, it, wa, included, in, the, london, pharmacopoeia, a, an, antimalarial, treatment, it, wa, not, until, that, the, active, ingredient, quinine, wa, extracted, from, the, bark, isolated, and, named, by, the, french, chemist, pierre, joseph, pelletier, and, joseph, caventou, artemisia, annua, source, of, the, antimalarial, drug, artemisin, quinine, become, the, predominant, malarial, medication, until, the, when, other, medication, began, to, be, developed, in, the, chloroquine, replaced, quinine, a, the, treatment, of, both, uncomplicated, and, severe, malaria, until, resistance, supervened, first, in, southeast, asia, and, south, america, in, the, and, then, globally, in, the, artemisinins, discovered, by, chinese, scientist, tu, youyou, and, colleague, in, the, from, the, plant, artemisia, annua, became, the, recommended, treatment, for, falciparum, malaria, administered, in, combination, with, other, antimalarial, a, well, a, in, severe, disease, plasmodium, vivax, wa, used, between, and, the, for, injection, of, malaria, parasite, to, induce, fever, to, combat, certain, disease, such, a,

spread, to, agriculture, in, time, pest, control, rather, than, disease, control, came, to, dominate, ddt, use, and, this, agricultural, use, led, to, the, evolution, of, resistant, mosquito, in, many, region, the, ddt, resistance, shown, by, anopheles, mosquito, can, be, compared, to, antibiotic, resistance, shown, by, bacteria, during, the, awareness, of, the, negative, consequence, of, it, indiscriminate, use, increased, ultimately, leading, to, ban, on, agricultural, application, of, ddt, in, many, country, in, the, before, ddt, malaria, wa, successfully, eliminated, or, controlled, in, tropical, area, like, brazil, and, egypt, by, removing, or, poisoning, the, breeding, ground, of, the, mosquito, or, the, aquatic, habitat, of, the, larva, stage, for, example, by, applying, the, highly, toxic, arsenic, compound, paris, green, to, place, with, standing, water, malaria, vaccine, have, been, an, elusive, goal, of, research, the, first, promising, study, demonstrating, the, potential, for, a, malaria, vaccine, were, performed, in, by, immunizing, mouse, with, live, sporozoite, which, provided, significant, protection, to, the, mouse, upon, subsequent, injection, with,

tissue, pathology, autoimmunity, molecular, mimicry, is, a, phenomenon, that, ha, been, just, recently, discovered, a, one, of, several, way, in, which, autoimmunity, can, be, evoked, a, molecular, mimicking, event, is, however, more, than, an, epiphenomenon, despite, it, low, statistical, probability, of, occurring, and, these, event, have, serious, implication, in, the, onset, of, many, human, autoimmune, disorder, in, the, past, decade, the, study, of, autoimmunity, the, failure, to, recognize, self, antigen, a, self, ha, grown, immensely, autoimmunity, is, a, result, of, a, loss, of, immunological, tolerance, the, ability, for, an, individual, to, discriminate, between, self, and, growth, in, the, field, of, autoimmunity, ha, resulted, in, more, and, more, frequent, diagnosis, of, autoimmune, disease, consequently, recent, data, show, that, autoimmune, disease, affect, approximately, in, people, within, the, general, population, growth, ha, also, led, to, a, greater, characterization, of, what, autoimmunity, is, and, how, it, can, be, studied, and, treated, with, an, increased, amount, of, research, there, ha, been, tremendous, growth, in, the, study, of, the, several, different, way, in, which, autoimmunity, can, occur, one, of, which, is, molecular, mimicry, the, mechanism, by, which, pathogen, have, evolved, or, obtained, by, chance, similar, amino, acid, sequence, or, the, homologous, crystal, structure, of, immunodominant, epitope, remains, a, mystery, content, immunological, tolerance, autoimmunity, probability, of, mimicry, event, structural, mimicry, epitope, spreading, implication, in, human, disease, disease, of, the, central, nervous, system, muscle, disorder, control, of, molecular, mimicry, conclusion, reference, further, reading, immunological, tolerance, edit, tolerance, is, a, fundamental, property, of, the, immune, system, tolerance, involves, discrimination, which, is, the, ability, of, the, normal, immune, system, to, recognize, and, respond, to, foreign, antigen, but, not, self, antigen, autoimmunity, is, evoked, when, this, tolerance, to, self, antigen, is, broken, tolerance, within, an, individual, is, normally, evoked, a, a, fetus, this, is, known, a, tolerance, where, t, cell, expressing, receptor, specific, for, a, particular, antigen, enter, the, circulation, of, the, developing, fetus, via, the, placenta, after, cell, leave, the, bone, marrow, where, they, are, synthesized, they, are, moved, to, the, thymus, where, the, maturation, of, t, cell, occurs, it, is, here, where, the, first, wave, of, t, cell, tolerance, arises, within, the, thymus, cell, will, encounter, various, self, and, foreign, antigen, present, in, the, thymus, that, enter, the, thymus, from, peripheral, site, via, the, circulatory, system, within, the, thymus, cell, undergo, a, selection, process, where, they, must, be, positively, selected, and, should, avoid, negative, selection, t, cell, that, bind, with, low, avidity, to, receptor, are, positively, selected, for, maturation, those, that, do, not, die, by, apoptosis, cell, that, survive, positive, selection, but, bind, strongly, to, are, negatively, selected, also, by, active, induction, of, apoptosis, this, negative, selection, is, known, a, clonal, deletion, one, of, the, mechanism, for, t, cell, tolerance, approximately, percent, of, cell, within, the, thymus, are, negatively, selected, only, approximately, percent, are, positively, selected, for, maturity, however, there, is, only, a, limited, repertoire, of, antigen, that, t, cell, can, encounter, within, the, thymus, t, cell, tolerance, then, must, occur, within, the, periphery, after, the, induction, of, t, cell, tolerance, within, the, thymus, a, a, more, diverse, group, of, antigen, can, be, encountered, in, peripheral, tissue, this, same, positive, and, negative, selection, mechanism, but, in, peripheral, tissue, is, known, a, clonal, anergy, the, mechanism, of, clonal, anergy, is, important, to, maintain, tolerance, to, many, autologous, antigen, active, suppression, is, the, other, known, mechanism, of, t, cell, tolerance, active, suppression, involves, the, injection, of, large, amount, of, foreign, antigen, in, the, absence, of, an, adjuvant, which, lead, to, a, state, of, unresponsiveness, this, unresponsive, state, is, then, transferred, to, a, recipient, from, the, injected, donor, to, induce, a, state, of, tolerance, within, the, recipient, tolerance, is, also, produced, in, b, cell, there, are, also, various, process, which, lead, to, b, cell, tolerance, just, a, in, t, cell, clonal, deletion, and, clonal, anergy, can, physically, eliminate, autoreactive, b, cell, clone, receptor, editing, is, another, mechanism, for, b, cell, tolerance, this, involves, the, reactivation, or, maintenance, of, v, d, j, recombination, in, the, cell, which, lead, to, the, expression, of, novel, receptor, specificity, through, v, region, gene, rearrangement, which, will, create, variation, in, the, heavy, and, light, immunoglobulin, ig, chain, autoimmunity, edit, autoimmunity, can, thus, be, defined, simply, a, exception, to, the, tolerance, rule, by, doing, this, an, immune, response, is, generated, against, and, cell, these, mechanism, are, known, by, many, to, be, intrinsic, however, there, are, pathogenic, mechanism, for, the, generation, of, autoimmune, disease, pathogen, can, induce, autoimmunity, by, polyclonal, activation, of, b, or, t, cell, or, increased, expression, of, major, histocompatibility, complex, mhc, class, i, or, ii, molecule, there, are, several, way, in, which, a, pathogen, can, cause, an, autoimmune, response, a, pathogen, may, contain, a, protein, that, act, a, a, mitogen, to, encourage, cell, division, thus, causing, more, b, or, t, cell, clone, to, be, produced, similarly, a, pathogenic, protein, may, act, a, a, superantigen, which, cause, rapid, polyclonal, activation, of, b, or, t, cell, pathogen, can, also, cause, the, release, of, cytokine, resulting, in, the, activation, of, b, or, t, cell, or, they, can, alter, macrophage, function, finally, pathogen, may, also, expose, b, or, t, cell, to, cryptic, determinant, which, are, self, antigen, determinant, that, have, not, been, processed, and, presented, sufficiently, to, tolerize, the, developing, t, cell, in, the, thymus, and, are, presented, at, the, periphery, where, the, infection, occurs, molecular, mimicry, ha, been, characterized, a, recently, a, the, a, another, mechanism, by, which, a, pathogen, can, generate, autoimmunity, molecular, mimicry, is, defined, a, similar, structure, shared, by, molecule, from, dissimilar, gene, or, by, their, protein, product, either, the, linear, amino, acid, sequence, or, the, conformational, fit, of, the, immunodominant, epitope, may, be, shared, between, the, pathogen, and, host, this, is, also, known, a, between, self, antigen, of, the, host, and, immunodominant, epitope, of, the, pathogen, an, autoimmune, response, is, then, generated, against, the, epitope, due, to, similar, sequence, homology, in, the, epitope, between, the, pathogen, and, the, host, cell, and, tissue, of, the, host, associated, with, the, protein, are, destroyed, a, a, result, of, the, autoimmune, response, probability, of, mimicry, event, edit, the, prerequisite, for, molecular, mimicry, to, occur, is, thus, the, sharing, of, the, immunodominant, epitope, between, the, pathogen, and, the, immunodominant, self, sequence, that, is, generated, by, a, cell, or, tissue, however, due, to, the, amino, acid, variation, between, different, protein, molecular, mimicry, should, not, happen, from, a, probability, standpoint, assuming, five, to, six, amino, acid, residue, are, used, to, induce, a, monoclonal, antibody, response, the, probability, of, amino, acid, occurring, in, six, identical, residue, between, two, protein, is, in, or, in, however, there, ha, been, evidence, shown, and, documented, of, many, molecular, mimicry, event, to, determine, which, epitope, are, shared, between, pathogen, and, self, large, protein, database, are, used, the, largest, protein, database, in, the, world, known, a, the, uniprot, database, formerly, swissprot, ha, shown, report, of, molecular, mimicry, becoming, more, common, with, expansion, of, the, database, the, database, currently, contains, x, residue, the, probability, of, finding, a, perfect, match, with, a, motif, of, amino, acid, in, length, is, in, x, therefore, within, the, swissprot, database, one, would, expect, to, find, x, x, x, match, however, there, are, sequence, motif, within, the, database, that, are, overrepresented, and, are, found, more, than, time, for, example, the, qkraa, sequence, is, an, amino, acid, motif, in, the, third, hypervariable, region, of, this, motif, is, also, expressed, on, numerous, other, protein, such, a, on, of, the, virus, and, in, coli, this, motif, occurs, time, in, the, database, this, would, suggest, that, the, linear, amino, acid, sequence, may, not, be, an, underlying, cause, of, molecular, mimicry, since, it, can, be, found, numerous, time, within, the, database, the, possibility, exists, then, for, variability, within, amino, acid, sequence, but, similarity, in, structure, between, two, peptide, can, be, recognized, by, t, cell, clone, this, therefore, uncovers, a, flaw, of, such, large, database, they, may, be, able, to, give, a, hint, to, relationship, between, epitope, but, the, important, structure, can, not, yet, be, searched, for, in, such, a, database, structural, mimicry, edit, despite, no, obvious, amino, acid, sequence, similarity, from, pathogen, to, host, factor, structural, study, have, revealed, that, mimicry, can, still, occur, at, the, host, level, in, some, case, pathogenic, mimic, can, posse, a, structural, architecture, that, differs, markedly, from, that, of, the, functional, homologues, therefore, protein, of, dissimilar, sequence, may, have, a, common, structure, which, elicits, an, autoimmune, response, it, ha, been, hypothesized, that, these, virulent, protein, display, their, mimicry, through, molecular, surface, that, mimic, host, protein, surface, protein, fold, or, conformation, which, have, been, obtained, by, convergent, evolution, it, ha, also, been, theorized, that, these, similar, protein, fold, have, been, obtained, by, horizontal, gene, transfer, most, likely, from, a, eukaryotic, host, this, further, support, the, theory, that, microbial, organism, have, evolved, a, mechanism, of, concealment, similar, to, that, of, higher, organism, such, a, the, african, praying, mantis, or, chameleon, who, camouflage, themselves, so, that, they, can, mimic, their, background, a, not, to, be, recognized, by, others, despite, dissimilar, sequence, homology, between, self, and, foreign, peptide, weak, electrostatic, interaction, between, foreign, peptide, and, the, mhc, can, also, mimic, self, peptide, to, elicit, an, autoimmune, response, within, the, host, for, example, charged, residue, can, explain, the, enhanced, and, reduced, of, a, particular, antigen, or, can, contribute, to, a, higher, affinity, and, activity, for, a, particular, antigen, that, can, perhaps, mimic, that, of, the, host, similarly, prominent, ridge, on, the, floor, of, groove, can, do, such, thing, a, create, bulge, in, particular, peptide, that, can, greatly, increase, the, interaction, between, foreign, and, self, peptide, on, the, mhc, similarly, there, ha, been, evidence, that, even, gross, feature, such, a, and, interaction, have, allowed, foreign, peptide, to, interact, with, an, antibody, or, mhc, and, tcr, it, is, now, apparent, that, sequence, similarity, consideration, are, not, sufficient, when, evaluating, potential, mimic, epitope, and, the, underlying, mechanism, of, molecular, mimicry, molecular, mimicry, from, these, example, ha, therefore, been, shown, to, occur, in, the, absence, of, any, true, sequence, homology, there, ha, been, increasing, evidence, for, mimicking, event, caused, not, only, by, amino, acid, similarity, but, also, in, similarity, in, binding, motif, to, the, mhc, molecular, mimicry, is, thus, occurring, between, two, recognized, peptide, that, have, similar, antigenic, surface, in, the, absence, of, primary, sequence, homology, for, example, specific, single, amino, acid, residue, such, a, cysteine, creates, bond, arginine, or, lysine, form, multiple, hydrogen, bond, could, be, essential, for, t, cell, these, single, residue, may, be, the, only, residue, conserved, between, self, and, foreign, antigen, that, allow, the, structurally, similar, but, sequence, peptide, to, bind, to, the, mhc, epitope, spreading, edit, epitope, spreading, is, another, common, way, in, which, autoimmunity, can, occur, which, us, the, molecular, mimicry, mechanism, this, inducer, of, autoimmunity, cause, autoreactive, t, cell, to, be, activated, de, novo, by, self, epitope, released, secondary, to, t, bystander, damage, t, cell, response, to, progressively, le, dominant, epitope, are, activated, a, a, consequence, of, the, release, of, other, antigen, secondary, to, the, destruction, of, the, pathogen, with, a, homologous, immunodominant, sequence, thus, inflammatory, response, induced, by, specific, pathogen, that, trigger, response, have, the, ability, to, persist, in, genetically, susceptible, host, this, may, lead, to, autoimmune, disease, conversely, epitope, spreading, could, be, due, to, target, antigen, being, physically, linked, intracellularly, a, member, of, a, complex, to, self, antigen, the, result, of, this, is, an, autoimmune, response, that, is, triggered, by, exogenous, antigen, that, progress, to, a, truly, autoimmune, response, against, mimicked, self, antigen, and, other, antigen, from, these, example, it, is, clear, that, the, search, for, candidate, mimic, epitope, must, extend, beyond, the, immunodominant, epitope, of, a, given, autoimmune, response, implication, in, human, disease, edit, disease, of, the, central, nervous, system, edit, the, virus, ha, been, shown, to, cause, disease, of, the, central, nervous, system, cns, in, human, through, a, molecular, mimicry, apparatus, is, used, to, bind, chemokines, on, the, cell, surface, of, the, host, so, that, the,

deworming, treatment, is, correlated, with, increased, school, attendance, the, impact, of, ntds, is, tied, to, gender, in, some, situation, ntds, disproportionately, affect, female, especially, schistosomiasis, dengue, hookworm, infection, during, pregnancy, and, the, risk, of, transferring, chaga, disease, during, pregnancy, a, study, in, uganda, found, that, woman, were, more, easily, able, to, obtain, treatment, because, they, had, fewer, occupational, responsibility, than, men, and, were, more, trusting, of, treatment, but, ignorance, of, the, effect, of, medicine, on, pregnant,

development, goal, such, a, education, child, mortality, and, maternal, health, are, impossible, to, fulfill, with, the, current, high, prevalence, of, ntds, he, also, state, that, many, individual, are, afflicted, by, more, than, one, ntd, deworming, treatment, in, those, who, are, infected, are, correlated, with, healthy, weight, gain, since, worm, are, often, partially, responsible, for,

bevaviours, are, also, required, together, with, deworming, treatment, hotez, argues, for, inclusion, of, ntds, into, initiative, for, malaria, and, tuberculosis, given, the, strong, link, between, these, disease, and, ntds, he, also, note, the, correlation, between, high, rate, of, ntds, and, high, rate, of, chronic, disease, such, a, heart, disease, and, cancer, he, attribute, these, to, the, debilitating, effect, of, ntds, and, their, long, term, toll, on, health, reason, for, neglect, edit, feasey, argues, that, this, group, of, disease, ha, been, overlooked, because, they, mainly, affect, the, poorest, country, of, the, developing, world, and, because, of, recent, emphasis, on, decreasing, the, prevalence, of, tuberculosis, and, malaria, fenwick, also, argues, that, far, more,

ectoparasite, parasite, that, live, on, the, outside, of, the, host, either, on, the, skin, or, the, outgrowth, of, the, skin, are, called, ectoparasite, louse, flea, and, some, mite, those, that, live, inside, the, host, are, called, endoparasite, including, all, parasitic, worm, endoparasite, can, exist, in, one, of, two, form, intercellular, parasite, inhabiting, space, in, the, body, or,

carrier, or, vector, the, vector, doe, the, job, of, transmitting, them, to, the, host, an, example, of, this, interaction, is, the, transmission, of, malaria, caused, by, a, protozoan, of, the, genus, plasmodium, to, human, by, the, bite, of, an, anopheline, mosquito, those, parasite, living, in, an, intermediate, position, being, and, are, called, mesoparasites, schistosoma, mansoni, is, an, endoparasite, that, life, in, human, blood, vessel, an, epiparasite, is, one, that, feed, on, another, parasite, this, relationship, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, a, hyperparasitism,

kleptes, thief, parasite, appropriate, food, gathered, by, the, host, an, example, is, the, brood, parasitism, practiced, by, cuckoo, and, cowbird, which, do, not, build, nest, of, their, own, and, leave, their, egg, in, nest, of, other, specie, the, host, behaves, a, a, babysitter, a, they, raise, the, young, a, their, own, if, the, host, remove, the, cuckoo, egg, some, cuckoo, will, return, and, attack, the, nest, to, compel, host, bird, to, remain, subject, to, this, parasitism, intraspecific, social, parasitism, may, also, occur, one, example, of, this, is, parasitic, nursing, where, some, individual, take, milk, from, unrelated, female, in, capuchin, higher, ranking, female, sometimes, take, milk, from, low, ranking, female, without, any, reciprocation, the, high, ranking, female, benefit, at, the, expense, of, the, low, ranking, female, parasitism, can, take, the, form, of, isolated, cheating, or, exploitation, among, more, generalized, mutualistic, interaction, for, example, broad, class, of, plant, and, fungi, exchange, carbon, and, nutrient, in, common, mutualistic, mycorrhizal, relationship, however, some, plant, specie, known, a, cheat, by, taking, carbon,

a, single, organism, without, the, involvement, of, another, host, therefore, the, primary, host, is, at, the, same, time, the, secondary, host, of, the, parasite, some, of, the, organism, where, autoinfection, occurs, are, strongyloides, stercoralis, enterobius, vermicularis, taenia, solium, and, hymenolepis, nana, strongyloidiasis, for, example, involves, premature, transformation, of,

mouth, the, stomach, is, the, next, line, of, defense, the, stomach, contains, hydrochloric, acid, and, gastric, acid, which, make, it, ph, level, around, in, this, environment, the, acidity, of, the, stomach, help, kill, most, microorganism, that, try, to, invade, the, body, through, the, gastric, intestinal, tract, eye, edit, parasite, can, also, invade, the, body, through, the, eye, the, lash,

will, kill, most, invading, microorganism, immune, system, edit, should, the, parasite, enter, the, body, the, immune, system, is, a, major, defense, against, parasitic, invasion, the, immune, system, is, made, up, of, different, family, of, molecule, these, include, serum, protein, and, pattern, recognition, receptor, prrs, prrs, are, intracellular, and, cellular, receptor, that, activate, dendritic, cell, which, in, turn, activate, the, adaptive, immune, lymphocyte, lymphocyte, such, a, the, t, cell, and, antibody, producing, b, cell, with, variable, receptor, that, recognize,

plant, undergo, a, series, of, metabolic, and, biochemical, reaction, pathway, that, will, enact, defensive, response, for, example, parasitic, invasion, cause, an, increase, in, the, jasmonic, ja, and, nahg, sa, pathway, these, pathway, produce, chemical, that, will, induce, defensive, response, such, a, the, production, of, chemical, or, defensive, molecule, to, fight, off, the, attack, different, biochemical, pathway, are, activated, by, different, parasite, in, general, there, are, two, type, of, response, that, can, be, activated, by, the, pathway, plant, can, either, initiate, a, specific, or, response, specific, response, involve, recognition, of, the, plant, and, parasite, this, can, be, mediated, by, the, ability, of, the, cell, receptor, recognizing, and, binding, molecule, that, are, located, on, the, cell, surface, of, parasite, once, the, receptor, recognizes, the, parasite, the, plant, localizes, the, defensive, compound, to, that, area, creating, a, hypersensitive, response, this, form, of, defense, mechanism, localizes, the, area, of, attack, and, keep, the, parasite, from, spreading, furthermore, a, specific, response, against, parasitic,

ability, to, recognize, a, parasite, specific, defense, response, be, activated, nonspecific, defensive, response, work, against, all, parasite, these, response, are, active, over, time, and, are, systematic, meaning, that, the, response, are, not, confined, to, an, area, of, the, plant, but, rather, spread, throughout, the, entirety, of, the, organism, however, nonspecific, response, are, energy, costly, since, the, plant, ha, to, ensure, that, the, gene, producing, the, nonspecific, response, are, always, expressed, evolutionary, aspect, edit, parasitism, ha, arisen, independently, many, time, depending, on, the, definition, used, a, many, a, half, of, all, animal, have, at, least, one, parasitic, phase, in, their, life, cycle, and, is, frequent, in, plant, and, fungi, almost, all, animal, are, host, to, one, or, more, parasitic, taxon, restoration, of, a, tyrannosaurus, with, parasite, infection, a, study, showed, that, hole, in, the, skull, of, several, specimen, might, have, been, caused, by, parasite, parasite, evolve, in, response, to, their, host, defence, sometimes, in, a, manner, specific, to, a, particular, host, taxon, and, specializing, to, the, point, where, they, infect, only, a, single, specie, such, narrow, host, specificity, can, be, costly, over, evolutionary, time, however, if, the, host, specie, becomes, extinct, therefore, many, parasite, can, infect, a, variety, of, more, or, le, closely, related, host, specie, with, different, success, rate, citation, needed, in, turn, host, defense, coevolve, in, response, to, attack, by, parasite, theoretically, parasite, may, have, an, advantage, in, this, evolutionary, arm, race, because, their, generation, time, commonly, is, shorter, host, reproduce, le, quickly, than, parasite, and, therefore, have, fewer, chance, to, adapt, than, their, parasite, do, over, a, given, span, of, time, coevolution, sometimes, lead, to, a, relatively, stable, relationship, tending, to, commensalism, or, mutualism, a, all, else, being, equal, it, is, in, the, evolutionary, interest, of, the, parasite, that, it, host, thrives, a, parasite, may, evolve, to, become, le, harmful, for, it, host, or, a, host, may, evolve, to, cope, with, the, unavoidable, presence, of, a, the, point, that, the, parasite, absence, cause, the, host, harm, for, example, although, animal, infected, with, parasitic, worm, are, often, clearly, harmed, and, therefore, parasitized, such, infection, may, also, reduce, the, prevalence, and, effect, of, autoimmune, disorder, in, animal, host, including, human, in, a, more, extreme, example, some, nematode, worm, can, not, reproduce, or, even, survive, without, infection, by, wolbachia, bacteria, competition, between, parasite, tends, to, favor, faster, reproducing, and, therefore, more, virulent, parasite, citation, needed, parasite, whose, life, cycle, involves, the, death, of, the, host, to, exit, the, present, host, and, sometimes, to, enter, the, next, evolve, to, be, more, virulent, or, even, alter, the, behavior, or, other, property, of, the, host, to, make, it, more, vulnerable, to, predator, parasite, that, reproduce, largely, to, the, offspring, of, the, previous, host, tend, to, become, le, virulent, or, mutualist, so, that, it, host, reproduce, more, effectively, the, presumption, of, a, shared, evolutionary, history, between, parasite, and, host, can, sometimes, elucidate, how, host, taxon, are, related, for, instance, there, ha, been, dispute, about, whether, flamingo, are, more, closely, related, to, the, stork, and, their, relative, or, to, duck, goose, and, their, relative, the, fact, that, flamingo, share, parasite, with, duck, and, goose, is, evidence, these, group, may, be, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, stork, parasitism, is, part, of, one, explanation, for, the, evolution, of, secondary, sex, characteristic, seen, in, breeding, male, throughout, the, animal, world, such, a, the, plumage, of, male, peacock, and, mane, of, male, lion, according, to, this, theory, female, host, select, male, for, breeding, based, on, such, characteristic, because, they, indicate, resistance, to, parasite, and, other, disease, edit, in, rare, case, a, parasite, may, even, undergo, with, it, host, one, particularly, remarkable, example, of, exists, between, the, simian, foamy, virus, sfv, and, it, primate, host, in, one, study, the, phylogeny, of, sfv, polymerase, and, the, mitochondrial, cytochrome, oxidase, subunit, ii, from, african, and, asian, primate, were, compared, surprisingly, the, phylogenetic, tree, were, very, congruent, in, branching, order, and, divergence, time, thus, the, simian, foamy, virus, may, have, with, old, world, primate, for, at, least, million, year, ecology, edit, quantitative, ecology, edit, a, single, parasite, specie, usually, ha, an, aggregated, distribution, across, host, individual, which, mean, that, most, host, harbor, few, parasite, while, a, few, host, carry, the, vast, majority, of, parasite, individual, this, pose, considerable, problem, for, student, of, parasite, ecology, the, use, of, parametric, statistic, should, be, avoided, citation, needed, of, data, before, the, application, of, parametric, test, or, the, use, of, statistic, is, recommended, by, several, author, however, this, can, give, rise, to, further, problem, therefore, modern, day, quantitative, parasitology, is, based, on, more, advanced, biostatistical, method, diversity, ecology, edit, host, represent, discrete, habitat, patch, that, can, be, occupied, by, parasite, a, hierarchical, set, of, terminology, ha, come, into, use, to, describe, parasite, assemblage, at, different, host, scale, infrapopulation, all, the, parasite, of, one, specie, in, a, single, individual, host, metapopulation, all, the, parasite, of, one, specie, in, a, host, population, infracommunity, all, the, parasite, of, all, specie, in, a, single, individual, host, component, community, all, the, parasite, of, all, specie, in, a, host, population, compound, community, all, the, parasite, of, all, specie, in, all, host, specie, in, an, ecosystem, the, diversity, ecology, of, parasite, differs, markedly, from, that, of, organism, for, organism, diversity, ecology, feature, many, strong, conceptual, framework, including, robert, macarthur, and, wilson, theory, of, island, biogeography, jared, diamond, assembly, rule, and, more, recently, null, model, such, a, stephen, hubbell, unified, neutral, theory, of, biodiversity, and, biogeography, framework, are, not, so, for, parasite, and, in, many, way, they, do, not, fit, the, model, for, example, island, biogeography, is, predicated, on, fixed, spatial, relationship, between, habitat, patch, sink, usually, with, reference, to, a, mainland, source, parasite, inhabit, host, which, represent, mobile, habitat, patch, with, dynamic, spatial, relationship, there, is, no, true, mainland, other, than, the, sum, of, host, host, population, so, parasite, component, community, in, host, population, are, metacommunities, nonetheless, different, type, of, parasite, assemblage, have, been, recognized, in, host, individual, and, population, and, many, of, the, pattern, observed, for, organism, are, also, pervasive, among, parasite, assemblage, the, most, prominent, of, these, is, the, continuum, this, proposes, that, parasite, assemblage, occur, along, a, cline, from, interactive, community, where, niche, are, saturated, and, interspecific, competition, is, high, to, isolationist, community, where, there, are, many, vacant, niche, and, interspecific, interaction, is, not, a, important, a, stochastic, factor, in, providing, structure, to, the, community, whether, this, is, so, or, whether, community, pattern, simply, reflect, the, sum, of, underlying, specie, distribution, no, real, structure, to, the, community, ha, not, yet, been, established, adaptation, edit, parasite,

infective, to, allopatric, from, different, geographical, region, host, citation, needed, experiment, published, in, discus, the, analysis, of, two, different, snail, population, from, two, different, lake, ianthe, and, lake, poerua, in, new, zealand, the, population, were, exposed, to, two, pure, parasite, digenetic, trematode, taken, from, the, same, lake, in, the, experiment, the, snail, were, infected, by, their, sympatric, parasite, allopatric, parasite, and, mixed, source, of, parasite, the, result, suggest, that, the, parasite, were, more, highly, effective, in, infecting, their,

referred, to, a, parasite, transmission, or, colonization, some, endoparasite, infect, their, host, by, penetrating, it, external, surface, while, others, must, be, ingested, once, inside, the, host, adult, endoparasite, need, to, shed, offspring, into, the, external, environment, to, infect, other, host, many, adult, endoparasite, reside, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, where, offspring, can, be, shed, along, with, host, excreta, adult, stage, of, tapeworm, worm, and, most, fluke, use, this, method, among, protozoan, endoparasite, such, a, the, malarial, parasite, and, trypanosomes, infective, stage, in, the, blood, are, transported, to, new, host, by, or, vector, larval, stage, of, endoparasite, often, infect, site, in, the, host, other, than, the, blood, or, gastrointestinal, tract, in, many, such, case, larval, endoparasite, require, their, host, to, be, consumed, by, the, next, host, in, the, life, cycle, in, order, to, survive, and, reproduce, alternatively, larval, endoparasite, may, shed, transmission, stage, that, migrate, through, the, tissue, into, the, external, environment, where, they, actively, search, for, or, await, ingestion, by, other, host, the, foregoing, strategy, are, used, variously, by, larval, stage, of, tapeworm, worm, fluke, and, parasitic, roundworm, some, ectoparasite, such, a, monogenean, worm, rely, on, direct, contact, between,

some, aquatic, leech, locate, host, by, sensing, movement, and, only, attach, when, certain, temperature, and, chemical, cue, are, present, some, parasite, modify, host, behavior, in, order, to, increase, the, transmission, between, host, often, in, relation, to, predator, and, prey, parasite, increased, trophic, transmission, for, example, in, california, salt, marsh, the, fluke, euhaplorchis, californiensis, reduces, the, ability, of, it, killifish, host, to, avoid, predator, this, parasite, matures, in, egret, which, are, more, likely, to, feed, on, infected, killifish, than, on, uninfected, fish, another, example, is, the, protozoan, toxoplasma, gondii, a, parasite, that, matures, in, cat, but, can, be, carried, by, many, other, mammal, uninfected, rat, avoid, cat, odor, but, rat, infected, with, gondii, are, drawn, to, this, scent, which, may, increase, transmission, to, feline, host, role, in, ecosystem, edit, modifying, the, behavior, of, infected, host, to, make, transmission, to, other, host, more, likely, to, occur, is, one, way, parasite, can, affect, the, structure, of, ecosystem, for, example, in, the, case, of, euhaplorchis, californiensis, discussed, above, it, is, plausible, that, the, local, predator, and, prey, specie, might, be, different, if, this, parasite, were, absent, from, the, system, although, parasite, are, often, omitted, in, depiction, of, food, web, they, usually, occupy, the, top, position, parasite, can, function, like, keystone, specie, reducing, the, dominance, of, superior, competitor, and, allowing, competing, specie, to, many, parasite, require, multiple, host, of, the, different, specie, to, complete, their, life, cycle, and, rely, on, or, other, stable, ecological, interaction, to, get, from, one, host,

limb, with, decreased, or, absent, tendon, reflex, in, the, affected, limb, that, can, not, be, attributed, to, another, apparent, cause, and, without, sensory, or, cognitive, loss, a, laboratory, diagnosis, is, usually, made, based, on, recovery, of, poliovirus, from, a, stool, sample, or, a, swab, of, the, pharynx, antibody, to, poliovirus, can, be, diagnostic, and, are, generally, detected, in, the, blood, of, infected, patient, early, in, the, course, of, infection, analysis, of, the, patient, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, which, is, collected, by, a, lumbar, puncture, spinal, tap, reveals, an, increased, number, of, white, blood, cell, primarily, lymphocyte, and, a, mildly, elevated, protein, level, detection, of, virus, in, the, csf, is, diagnostic, of, paralytic, polio, but, rarely, occurs, if, poliovirus, is, isolated, from, a, patient, experiencing, acute, flaccid, paralysis, it, is, further, tested, through, oligonucleotide, mapping, genetic, fingerprinting, or, more, recently, by, pcr, amplification, to, determine, whether, it, is, wild, type, that, is, the, virus, encountered, in, nature, or, vaccine, type, derived, from, a, strain, of, poliovirus, used, to, produce, polio, vaccine, it, is, important, to, determine, the, source, of, the, virus, because, for, each, reported, case, of, paralytic, polio, caused, by, wild, poliovirus, an, estimated, to, other, contagious, asymptomatic, carrier, exist, prevention, passive, immunization, in, william, hammon, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, purified, the, gamma, globulin, component, of, the, blood, plasma, of, polio, survivor, hammon, proposed, the, gamma, globulin, which, contained, antibody, to, poliovirus, could, be, used, to, halt, poliovirus, infection, prevent, disease, and, reduce, the, severity, of, disease, in, other, patient, who, had, contracted, polio, the, result, of, a, large, clinical, trial, were, promising, the, gamma, globulin, wa, shown, to, be, about, effective, in, preventing, the, development, of, paralytic, poliomyelitis, it, wa, also, shown, to, reduce, the, severity, of, the, disease, in, patient, who, developed, polio, the, gamma, globulin, approach, wa, later, deemed, impractical, for, widespread, use, however, due, in, large, part, to, the, limited, supply, of, blood, plasma, so, the, medical, community, turned, it, focus, to, the, development, of, a, polio, vaccine, vaccine, main, article, polio, vaccine, a, child, receiving, an, oral, polio, vaccine, two, type, of, vaccine, are, used, throughout, the, world, to, combat, polio, both, type, induce, immunity, to, polio, efficiently, blocking, transmission, of, wild, poliovirus, thereby, protecting, both, individual, vaccine, recipient, and, the, wider, community, herd, immunity, the, first, candidate, polio, vaccine, based, on, one, serotype, of, a, live, but, attenuated, weakened, virus, wa, developed, by, the, virologist, hilary, koprowski, koprowski, prototype, vaccine, wa, given, to, an, boy, on, february, koprowski, continued, to, work, on, the, vaccine, throughout, the, leading, to, trial, in, the, then, belgian, congo, and, the, vaccination, of, seven, million, child, in, poland, against, serotypes, and, between, and, the, second, inactivated, virus, vaccine, wa, developed, in, by, jonas, salk, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, and, announced, to, the, world, on, april, the, salk, vaccine, or, inactivated, poliovirus, vaccine, ipv, is, based, on, poliovirus, grown, in, a, type, of, monkey, kidney, tissue, culture, vero, cell, line, which, is, chemically, inactivated, with, formalin, after, two, dos, of, ipv, given, by, injection, or, more, of, individual, develop, protective, antibody, to, all, three, serotypes, of, poliovirus, and, at, least, are, immune, to, poliovirus, following, three, dos, subsequently, albert, sabin, developed, another, live, oral, polio, vaccine, opv, it, wa, produced, by, the, repeated, passage, of, the, virus, through, nonhuman, cell, at, subphysiological, temperature, the, attenuated, poliovirus, in, the, sabin, vaccine, replicates, very, efficiently, in, the, gut, the, primary, site, of, wild, poliovirus, infection, and, replication, but, the, vaccine, strain, is, unable, to, replicate, efficiently, within, nervous, system, tissue, a, single, dose, of, sabin, oral, polio, vaccine, produce, immunity, to, all, three, poliovirus, serotypes, in, about, of, recipient, three, dos, of, opv, produce, protective, antibody, to, all, three, poliovirus, type, in, more, than, of, recipient, human, trial, of, sabin, vaccine, began, in, and, in, it, wa, selected, in, competition, with, the, live, vaccine, of, koprowski, and, other, researcher, by, the, u, national, institute, of, health, licensed, in, it, rapidly, became, the, only, polio, vaccine, used, worldwide, because, opv, is, inexpensive, easy, to, administer, and, produce, excellent, immunity, in, the, intestine, which, help, prevent, infection, with, wild, virus, in, area, where, it, is, endemic, it, ha, been, the, vaccine, of, choice, for, controlling, poliomyelitis, in, many, country, on, very, rare, occasion, about, one, case, per, vaccine, recipient, the, attenuated, virus, in, opv, reverts, into, a, form, that, can, paralyze, most, industrialized, country, have, switched, to, ipv, which, can, not, revert, either, a, the, sole, vaccine, against, poliomyelitis, or, in, combination, with, oral, polio, vaccine, treatment, there, is, no, cure, for, polio, the, focus, of, modern, treatment, ha, been, on, providing, relief, of, symptom, speeding, recovery, and, preventing, complication, supportive, measure, include, antibiotic, to, prevent, infection, in, weakened, muscle, analgesic, for, pain, moderate, exercise, and, a, nutritious, diet, treatment, of, polio, often, requires, rehabilitation, including, occupational, therapy, physical, therapy, brace, corrective, shoe, and, in, some, case, orthopedic, surgery, portable, ventilator, may, be, required, to, support, breathing, historically, a, noninvasive, ventilator, more, commonly, called, an, iron, lung, wa, used, to, artificially, maintain, respiration, during, an, acute, polio, infection, until, a, person, could, breathe, independently, generally, about, one, to, two, week, today, many, polio, survivor, with, permanent, respiratory, paralysis, use, modern, ventilator, worn, over, the, chest, and, abdomen, other, historical, treatment, for, polio, include, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, massage, and, passive, motion, exercise, and, surgical, treatment, such, a, tendon, lengthening, and, nerve, grafting, prognosis, a, child, with, a, deformity, of, her, right, leg, due, to, polio, patient, with, abortive, polio, infection, recover, completely, in, those, who, develop, only, aseptic, meningitis, the, symptom, can, be, expected, to, persist, for, two, to, ten, day, followed, by, complete, recovery, in, case, of, spinal, polio, if, the, affected, nerve, cell, are, completely, destroyed, paralysis, will, be, permanent, cell, that, are, not, destroyed, but, lose, function, temporarily, may, recover, within, four, to, six, week, after, onset, half, the, patient, with, spinal, polio, recover, fully, recover, with, mild, disability, and, the, remaining, quarter, are, left, with, severe, disability, the, degree, of, both, acute, paralysis, and, residual, paralysis, is, likely, to, be, proportional, to, the, degree, of, viremia, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, degree, of, immunity, spinal, polio, is, rarely, fatal, without, respiratory, support, consequence, of, poliomyelitis, with, respiratory, involvement, include, suffocation, or, pneumonia, from, aspiration, of, secretion, overall, of, patient, with, paralytic, polio, die, due, to, the, paralysis, of, muscle, used, for, breathing, the, case, fatality, rate, cfr, varies, by, age, of, child, and, up, to, of, adult, die, bulbar, polio, often, cause, death, if, respiratory, support, is, not, provided, with, support, it, cfr, range, from, to, depending, on, the, age, of, the, patient, when, intermittent, positive, pressure, ventilation, is, available, the, fatality, can, be, reduced, to, recovery, many, case, of, poliomyelitis, result, in, only, temporary, paralysis, nerve, impulse, return, to, the, formerly, paralyzed, muscle, within, a, month, and, recovery, is, usually, complete, in, six, to, eight, month, the, neurophysiological, process, involved, in, recovery, following, acute, paralytic, poliomyelitis, are, quite, effective, muscle, are, able, to, retain, normal, strength, even, if, half, the, original, motor, neuron, have, been, lost, paralysis, remaining, after, one, year, is, likely, to, be, permanent, although, modest, recovery, of, muscle, strength, are, possible, to, month, after, infection, one, mechanism, involved, in, recovery, is, nerve, terminal, sprouting, in, which, remaining, brainstem, and, spinal, cord, motor, neuron, develop, new, branch, or, axonal, sprout, these, sprout, can, reinnervate, orphaned, muscle, fiber, that, have, been, denervated, by, acute, polio, infection, restoring, the, fiber, capacity, to, contract, and, improving, strength, terminal, sprouting, may, generate, a, few, significantly, enlarged, motor, neuron, doing, work, previously, performed, by, a, many, a, four, or, five, unit, a, single, motor, neuron, that, once, controlled, muscle, cell, might, control, to, cell, other, mechanism, that, occur, during, the, rehabilitation, phase, and, contribute, to, muscle, strength, restoration, include, myofiber, of, muscle, fiber, through, exercise, and, transformation, of, type, ii, muscle, fiber, to, type, i, muscle, fiber, in, addition, to, these, physiological, process, the, body, posse, a, number, of, compensatory, mechanism, to, maintain, function, in, the, presence, of, residual, paralysis, these, include, the, use, of, weaker, muscle, at, a, higher, than, usual, intensity, relative, to, the, muscle, maximal, capacity, enhancing, athletic, development, of, previously, muscle, and, using, ligament, for, stability, which, enables, greater, mobility, complication, residual, complication, of, paralytic, polio, often, occur, following, the, initial, recovery, process, muscle, paresis, and, paralysis, can, sometimes, result, in, skeletal, deformity, tightening, of, the, joint, and, movement, disability, once, the, muscle, in, the, limb, become, flaccid, they, may, interfere, with, the, function, of, other, muscle, a, typical, manifestation, of, this, problem, is, equinus, foot, similar, to, club, foot, this, deformity, develops, when, the, muscle, that, pull, the, toe, downward, are, working, but, those, that, pull, it, upward, are, not, and, the, foot, naturally, tends, to, drop, toward, the, ground, if, the, problem, is, left, untreated, the, achilles, tendon, at, the, back, of, the, foot, retract, and, the, foot, can, not, take, on, a, normal, position, polio, victim, that, develop, equinus, foot, can, not, walk, properly, because, they, can, not, put, their, heel, on, the, ground, a, similar, situation, can, develop, if, the, arm, become, paralyzed, in, some, case, the, growth, of, an, affected, leg, is, slowed, by, polio, while, the, other, leg, continues, to, grow, normally, the, result, is, that, one, leg, is, shorter, than, the, other, and, the, person, limp, and, lean, to, one, side, in, turn, leading, to, deformity, of, the, spine, such, a, scoliosis, osteoporosis, and, increased, likelihood, of, bone, fracture, may, occur, an, intervention, to, prevent, or, lessen, length, disparity, can, be, to, perform, an, epiphysiodesis, on, the, distal, femoral, and, proximal, condyle, so, that, limb, growth, is, artificially, stunted, and, by, the, time, of, epiphyseal, growth, plate, closure, the, leg, are, more, equal, in, length, other, surgery, to, muscular, imbalance, may, also, be, helpful, extended, use, of, brace, or, wheelchair, may, cause, compression, neuropathy, a, well, a, a, loss, of, proper, function, of, the, vein, in, the, leg, due, to, pooling, of, blood, in, paralyzed, lower, limb, complication, from, prolonged, immobility, involving, the, lung, kidney, and, heart, include, pulmonary, edema, aspiration, pneumonia, urinary, tract, infection, kidney, stone, paralytic, ileus, myocarditis, and, cor, pulmonale, syndrome, main, article, syndrome, between, and, of, individual, who, have, recovered, from, paralytic, polio, in, childhood, can, develop, additional, symptom, decade, after, recovering, from, the, acute, infection, notably, new, muscle, weakness, and, extreme, fatigue, this, condition, is, known, a, syndrome, pps, or, sequela, the, symptom, of, pps, are, thought, to, involve, a, failure, of, the, motor, unit, created, during, the, recovery, phase, of, the, paralytic, disease, contributing, factor, that, increase, the, risk, of, pps, include, aging, with, loss, of, neuron, unit, the, presence, of, a, permanent, residual, impairment, after, recovery, from, the, acute, illness, and, both, overuse, and, disuse, of, neuron, pps, is, a, slow, progressive, disease, and, there, is, no, specific, treatment, for, it, syndrome, is, not, an, infectious, process, and, person, experiencing, the, syndrome, do,

from, defined, component, prpc, lipid, and, a, synthetic, polyanionic, molecule, these, researcher, also, showed, that, the, polyanionic, molecule, required, for, prion, formation, wa, selectively, incorporated, into, complex, with, prp, molecule, leading, them, to, hypothesize, that, infectious, prion, may, be, composed, of, multiple, host, component, including, prp, lipid, and, polyanionic,

be, animal, and, studied, in, department, of, zoology, while, photosynthetic, microbe, and, microscopic, assigned, to, the, plant, and, studied, in, department, of, botany, criticism, of, this, system, began, in, the, latter, half, of, the, century, with, the, realization, that, many, organism, met, the, criterion, for, inclusion, among, both, plant, and, animal, for, example, the, algae, euglena, and, dinobryon, have, chloroplast, for, photosynthesis, but, can, also, feed, on, organic, matter, and, are, motile, in, john, hogg, argued, against, the, use, of, protozoa, on, the, ground, that, naturalist, are, divided, in, probably, some, will, ever, continue, many, of, these, organism, or, living, being, are, animal, or, plant, a, an, alternative, he, proposed, a, new, kingdom, called, primigenum, consisting, of, both, the, protozoa, and, unicellular, algae, protophyta, which, he, combined, together, under, the, name, protoctista, in, hogg, conception, the, animal, and,

he, named, protista, at, first, haeckel, included, a, few, multicellular, organism, in, this, kingdom, but, in, later, work, he, restricted, the, protista, to, organism, or, simple, colony, whose, individual, cell, are, not, differentiated, into, different, kind, of, tissue, despite, these, proposal, protozoa, emerged, a, the, preferred, taxonomic, placement, for, heterotrophic, microbe, such, a, amoeba, and, ciliate, and, remained, so, for, more, than, a, century, in, the, course, of, the, century, however, the, old, two, kingdom, system, began, to, weaken, with, the, growing, awareness, that, fungi, did, not, belong, among, the, plant, and, that, most, of, the, unicellular, protozoa, were, no, more, closely, related, to, the, animal, than, they, were, to, the, plant, by, some,

human, growth, hormone, mrsa, infection, is, often, acquired, a, a, result, of, a, stay, in, hospital, transmission, edit, further, information, vector, epidemiology, a, vector, is, an, organism, that, doe, not, cause, disease, itself, but, that, transmits, infection, by, conveying, pathogen, from, one, host, to, another, the, route, of, transmission, is, important, to, epidemiologist, because, pattern, of, contact, vary, between, different, population, and, different, group, of, population, depending, on, cultural, and, other, feature, for, example, low, personal, and, food, hygiene, due, to, the, lack, of, a, clean, water, supply, may, result, in, increased, transmission, of, disease, by, the, route, such, a, cholera, difference, in, incidence, of, such, disease, between, different, group, can, also, throw, light, on, the, route, of, transmission, of, the, disease, for, example, if, it, is, noted, that, polio, is, more, common, in, city, in, underdeveloped, country, without, a, clean, water, supply, than, in, city, with, a, good, plumbing, system, we, might, advance, the, theory, that, polio, is, spread, by, the, can, be, minimised, to, a, certain, extent, if, we, all, consider, being, sure, of, what, we, do, vector, may, be, mechanical, or, biological, a, mechanical, vector, pick, up, an, infectious, agent, on, the, outside, of, it, body, and, transmits, it, in, a, passive, manner, an, example, of, a, mechanical, vector, is, a, housefly, which, land, on, cow, dung, contaminating, it, appendage, with, bacteria, from, the, feces, and, then, land, on, food, prior, to, consumption, the, pathogen, never, enters, the, body, of, the, fly, in, contrast, biological, vector, harbor, pathogen, within, their, body, and, deliver, pathogen, to, new, host, in, an, active, manner, usually, a, bite, biological, vector, are, often, responsible, for, serious, disease, such, a, malaria, viral, encephalitis, chaga, disease, lyme, disease, and, african, sleeping, sickness, biological, vector, are, usually, though, not, exclusively, arthropod, such, a, mosquito, tick, flea, and, louse, vector, are, often, required, in, the, life, cycle, of, a, pathogen, a, common, strategy, used, to, control, vector, borne, infectious, disease, is, to, interrupt, the, life, cycle, of, a, pathogen, by, killing, the, vector, infectivity, edit, the, term, infectivity, describes, the, ability, of, an, organism, to, enter, survive, and, multiply, in, the, host, while, the, infectiousness, of, a, disease, indicates, the, comparative, ease, with, which, the, disease, is, transmitted, to, other, host, transmission, of, pathogen, can, occur, in, various, way, including, physical, contact, contaminated, food, body, fluid, object, airborne, inhalation,

factor, make, people, more, susceptible, to, tb, infection, the, most, important, risk, factor, globally, is, hiv, of, all, people, with, tb, are, infected, by, the, virus, this, is, a, particular, problem, in, africa, where, rate, of, hiv, are, high, of, people, without, hiv, who, are, infected, with, tuberculosis, about, develop, active, disease, during, their, lifetime, in, contrast, of, those, coinfected, with, hiv, develop, the, active, disease, tuberculosis, is, closely, linked, to, both, overcrowding, and, malnutrition, making, it, one, of, the, principal, disease, of, poverty, those, at, high, risk, thus, include, people, who, inject, illicit, drug, inhabitant, and, employee, of, locale, where, vulnerable, people, gather, prison, and, homeless, shelter, medically,

aerosol, droplet, to, in, diameter, a, single, sneeze, can, release, up, to, droplet, each, one, of, these, droplet, may, transmit, the, disease, since, the, infectious, dose, of, tuberculosis, is, very, small, the, inhalation, of, fewer, than, bacteria, may, cause, an, infection, people, with, prolonged, frequent, or, close, contact, with, people, with, tb, are, at, particularly, high, risk, of, becoming, infected, with, an, estimated, infection, rate, a, person, with, active, but, untreated, tuberculosis, may, infect, or, more, other, people, per, year, transmission, should, occur, from, only, people, with, active, tb, those, with, latent, infection, are, not, thought, to, be, contagious, the, probability, of, transmission, from, one, person, to, another, depends, upon, several, factor, including, the, number, of, infectious, droplet, expelled, by, the, carrier, the, effectiveness, of, ventilation, the, duration, of, exposure, the, virulence, of, the, tuberculosis, strain, the, level, of, immunity, in, the, uninfected, person, and, others, the, cascade, of, spread, can, be, circumvented, by, effectively, segregating, those, with, active, overt, tb, and, putting, them, on, drug, regimen, after, about, two, week, of, effective, treatment, subject, with, nonresistant, active, infection, generally, do, not, remain, contagious, to, others, if, someone, doe, become,

latent, infection, will, progress, to, overt, active, tuberculous, disease, in, those, with, hiv, the, risk, of, developing, active, tb, increase, to, nearly, a, year, if, effective, treatment, is, not, given, the, death, rate, for, active, tb, case, is, up, to, tb, infection, begin, when, the, mycobacteria, reach, the, pulmonary, alveolus, where, they, invade, and, replicate, within, endosomes, of, alveolar, macrophage, macrophage, identify, the, bacterium, a, foreign, and, attempt, to, eliminate, it, by, phagocytosis, during, this, process, the, bacterium, is, enveloped, by, the, macrophage, and, stored, temporarily, in, a, vesicle, called, a, phagosome, the, phagosome, then, combine, with, a, lysosome, to, create, a, phagolysosome, in, the, phagolysosome, the, cell, attempt, to, use, reactive, oxygen, specie, and, acid, to, kill, the, bacterium, however, tuberculosis, ha, a, thick, waxy, mycolic, acid, capsule, that, protects, it, from, these, toxic, substance, tuberculosis, is, able, to, reproduce, inside, the, macrophage, and, will, eventually, kill, the, immune, cell, the, primary, site, of, infection, in, the, lung, known, a, the, ghon, focus, is, generally, located, in, either, the, upper, part, of, the, lower, lobe, or, the, lower, part, of, the, upper, lobe, tuberculosis, of, the, lung, may, also, occur, via, infection, from, the, blood, stream, this, is, known, a, a, simon, focus, and, is, typically, found, in, the, top, of, the, lung, this, hematogenous, transmission, can, also, spread, infection, to, more, distant, site, such, a, peripheral, lymph, node, the, kidney, the, brain, and, the, bone, all, part, of, the, body, can, be, affected, by, the, disease, though, for, unknown, reason, it, rarely, affect, the, heart, skeletal, muscle, pancreas, or, thyroid, tuberculosis, is, classified, a, one, of, the, granulomatous, inflammatory, disease, macrophage, t, lymphocyte, b, lymphocyte, and, fibroblast, aggregate, to, form, granuloma, with, lymphocyte, surrounding, the, infected, macrophage, when, other, macrophage, attack, the, infected, macrophage, they, fuse, together, to, form, a, giant, multinucleated, cell, in, the, alveolar, lumen, the, granuloma, may, prevent, dissemination, of, the, mycobacteria, and, provide, a, local, environment, for, interaction, of, cell, of, the, immune, system, however, more, recent, evidence, suggests, that, the, bacteria, use, the, granuloma, to, avoid, destruction, by, the, host, immune, system, macrophage, and, dendritic, cell, in, the, granuloma, are, unable, to, present, antigen, to, lymphocyte, thus, the, immune, response, is, suppressed, bacteria, inside, the, granuloma, can, become, dormant, resulting, in, latent, infection, another, feature, of, the, granuloma, is, the, development, of, abnormal, cell, death, necrosis, in, the, center, of, tubercle, to, the, naked, eye, this, ha, the, texture, of, soft, white, cheese, and, is, termed, caseous, necrosis, if, tb, bacteria, gain, entry, to, the, blood, stream, from, an, area, of, damaged, tissue, they, can, spread, throughout, the, body, and, set, up, many, focus, of, infection, all, appearing, a, tiny, white, tubercle, in, the, tissue, this, severe, form, of, tb, disease, most, common, in, young, child, and, those, with, hiv, is, called, miliary, tuberculosis, people, with, this,

tuberculosis, diagnosing, active, tuberculosis, based, merely, on, sign, and, symptom, is, difficult, a, is, diagnosing, the, disease, in, those, who, are, immunosuppressed, a, diagnosis, of, tb, should, however, be, considered, in, those, with, sign, of, lung, disease, or, constitutional, symptom, lasting, longer, than, two, week, a, chest, and, multiple, sputum, culture, for, bacillus, are, typically, part, of, the, initial, evaluation, release, assay, and, tuberculin, skin, test, are, of, little, use, in, the, developing, world, igra, have, similar, limitation, in, those, with, hiv, a, definitive, diagnosis, of, tb, is, made, by, identifying, tuberculosis, in, a, clinical, sample, sputum, pu, or, a, tissue, biopsy, however, the, difficult, culture, process, for, this, organism, can, take, two, to, six, week, for, blood, or, sputum, culture, thus, treatment, is, often, begun, before, culture, are, confirmed, nucleic, acid, amplification, test, and, adenosine, deaminase, testing, may, allow, rapid, diagnosis, of, tb, these, test, however, are, not, routinely, recommended, a, they, rarely, alter, how, a, person, is, treated, blood, test, to, detect, antibody, are, not,

began, in, the, century, with, the, work, of, edward, jenner, type, edit, vaccine, work, by, presenting, a, foreign, antigen, to, the, immune, system, to, evoke, an, immune, response, but, there, are, several, way, to, do, this, four, main, type, are, currently, in, clinical, use, an, inactivated, vaccine, consists, of, virus, or, bacteria, that, are, grown, in, culture, and, then, killed, using, a, method, such, a, heat, or, formaldehyde, although, the, virus, or, bacteria, particle, are, destroyed, and, can, not, replicate, the, virus, capsid, protein, or, bacterial, wall, are, intact, enough, to, be, recognized, and, remembered, by, the, immune, system, and, evoke, a, response, when, manufactured, correctly, the, vaccine, is, not, infectious, but, improper, inactivation, can, result, in, intact, and, infectious, particle, since, the, properly, produced, vaccine, doe, not, reproduce, booster, shot, are, required, periodically, to, reinforce, the, immune, response, in, an, attenuated, vaccine, live, virus, or, bacteria, with, very, low, virulence, are, administered, they, will, replicate, but, locally, or, very, slowly, since, they, do, reproduce, and, continue, to, present, antigen, to, the, immune, system, beyond, the, initial, vaccination, booster, may, be, required, le, often, these, vaccine, may, be, produced, by, passaging, for, example, adapting, a, virus, into, different, host, cell, culture, such, a, in, animal, or, at, suboptimal, temperature, allowing, selection, of, le, virulent, strain, or, by, mutagenesis, or, targeted, deletion, in, gene,

the, ability, to, break, free, from, the, host, cell, and, infect, other, cell, of, particular, interest, here, is, mimivirus, a, giant, virus, that, infects, amoeba, and, encodes, much, of, the, molecular, machinery, traditionally, associated, with, bacteria, is, it, a, simplified, version, of, a, parasitic, prokaryote, or, did, it, originate, a, a, simpler, virus, that, acquired, gene, from, it, host, the, evolution, of, virus, which, often, occurs, in, concert, with, the, evolution, of, their, host, is, studied, in, the, field, of, viral, evolution, while, virus, reproduce, and, evolve, they, do, not, engage, in, metabolism, do, not, move, and, depend, on, a, host, cell, for, reproduction, the, question, of, whether, they, are, alive, or, not, is, a, matter, of, definition, that, doe, not, affect, the, biological, reality, of, virus, viral, disease, and, host, defense, edit, one, main, motivation, for, the, study, of, virus, is, the, fact, that, they, cause, many, important, infectious, disease, among, them, the, common, cold, influenza, rabies, measles, many, form, of, diarrhea, hepatitis, dengue, fever, yellow, fever, polio, smallpox, and, aid, herpes, simplex, cause, cold, sore, and, genital, herpes, and, is, under, investigation, a, a, possible, factor, in, alzheimer, some, virus, known, a, oncoviruses, contribute, to, the, development, of, certain, form, of, cancer, the, best, studied, example, is, the, association, between, human, papillomavirus, and, cervical, cancer, almost, all, case, of, cervical, cancer, are, caused, by, certain, strain, of, this, sexually, transmitted, virus, another, example, is, the, association, of, infection, with, hepatitis, b, and, hepatitis, c, virus, and, liver, cancer, some, subviral, particle, also, cause, disease, the, transmissible, spongiform, encephalopathy, which, include, kuru, disease, and, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, mad, cow, disease, are, caused, by, prion, hepatitis, d, is, due, to, a, satellite, virus, the, study, of, the, manner, in, which, virus, cause, disease, is, viral, pathogenesis, the, degree, to, which, a, virus, cause, disease, is, it, virulence, when, the, immune, system, of, a, vertebrate, encounter, a, virus, it, may, produce, specific, antibody, which, bind, to, the, virus, and, neutralize, it, infectivity, or, mark, it, for, destruction, antibody, presence, in, blood, serum, is, often, used, to, determine, whether, a, person, ha, been, exposed, to, a, given, virus, in, the, past, with, test, such, a, elisa, vaccination, protect, against, viral, disease, in, part, by, eliciting, the, production, of, antibody, monoclonal, antibody, specific, to, the, virus, are, also, used, for, detection, a, in, fluorescence, microscopy, a, second, defense, of, vertebrate, against, virus, immunity, involves, immune, cell, known, a, t, cell, the, body, cell, constantly, display, short, fragment, of, their, protein, on, the, cell, surface, and, if, a, t, cell, recognizes, a, suspicious, viral, fragment, there, the, host, cell, is, destroyed, and, the, proliferate, this, mechanism, is, by, certain, vaccination, rna, interference, an, important, cellular, mechanism, found, in, plant, animal, and, many, other, eukaryote, most, likely, evolved, a, a, defense, against, virus, an, elaborate, machinery, of, interacting, enzyme, detects, rna, molecule, which, occur, a, part, of, the, life, cycle, of, many, virus, and, then, proceeds, to, destroy, all, version, of, those, detected, rna, molecule, every, lethal, viral, disease, present, a, paradox, killing, it, host, is, obviously, of, no, benefit, to, the, virus, so, how, and, why, did, it, evolve, to, do, so, today, it, is, believed, that, most, virus, are, relatively, benign, in, their, natural, host, some, viral, infection, might, even, be, beneficial, to, the, host, the, lethal, viral, disease, are, believed, to, have, resulted, from, an, accidental, jump, of, the, virus, from, a, specie, in, which, it, is, benign, to, a, new, one, that, is, not, accustomed, to, it, see, zoonosis, for, example, virus, that, cause, serious, influenza, in, human, probably, have, pig, or, bird, a, their, natural, host, and, hiv, is, thought, to, derive, from, the, benign, primate, virus, siv, while, it, ha, been, possible, to, prevent, certain, viral, disease, by, vaccination, for, a, long, time, the, development, of, antiviral, drug, to, treat, viral, disease, is, a, comparatively, recent, development, the, first, such, drug, wa, interferon, a, substance, that, is, naturally, produced, when, an, infection, is, detected, and, stimulates, other, part, of, the, immune, system, molecular, biology, research, and, viral, therapy, edit, bacteriophage, the, virus, which, infect, bacteria, can, be, relatively, easily, grown, a, viral, plaque, on, bacterial, culture, bacteriophage, occasionally, move, genetic, material, from, one, bacterial, cell, to, another, in, a, process, known, a, transduction, and, this, horizontal, gene, transfer, is, one, reason, why, they, served, a, a, major, research, tool, in, the, early, development, of, molecular, biology, the, genetic, code, the, function, of, ribozymes, the, first, recombinant, dna, and, early, genetic, library, were, all, arrived, at, using, bacteriophage, certain, genetic, element, derived, from, virus, such, a, highly, effective, promoter, are, commonly, used, in, molecular, biology, research, today, growing, animal, virus, outside, of, the, living, host, animal, is, more, difficult, classically, fertilized, chicken, egg, have, often, been, used, but, cell, culture, are, increasingly, employed, for, this, purpose, today, since, some, virus, that, infect, eukaryote, need, to, transport, their, genetic, material, into, the, host, cell, nucleus, they, are, attractive, tool, for, introducing, new, gene, into, the, host, known, a, transformation, or, transfection, modified, retrovirus, are, often, used, for, this, purpose, a, they, integrate, their, gene, into, the, host, chromosome, this, approach, of, using, virus, a, gene, vector, is, being, pursued, in, the, gene, therapy, of, genetic, disease, an, obvious, problem, to, be, overcome, in, viral, gene, therapy, is, the, rejection, of, the, transforming, virus, by, the, immune, system, phage, therapy, the, use, of, bacteriophage, to, combat, bacterial, disease, wa, a, popular, research, topic, before, the, advent, of, antibiotic, and, ha, recently, seen, renewed, interest, oncolytic, virus, are, virus, that, preferably, infect, cancer, cell, while, early, effort, to, employ, these, virus, in, the, therapy, of, cancer, failed, there, have, been, report, in, and, of, encouraging, preliminary, result, other, us, of, virus, edit, a,

very, early, form, of, vaccination, known, a, variolation, wa, developed, several, thousand, year, ago, in, china, it, involved, the, application, of, material, from, smallpox, sufferer, in, order, to, immunize, others, in, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, observed, the, practice, in, istanbul, and, attempted, to, popularize, it, in, britain, but, encountered, considerable, resistance, in, edward, jenner, developed, a, much, safer, method, using, cowpox, to, successfully, immunize, a, young, boy, against, smallpox, and, this, practice, wa, widely, adopted, vaccination, against, other, viral, disease, followed, including, the, successful, rabies, vaccination, by, louis, pasteur, in, the, nature, of, virus, however, wa, not, clear, to, these, researcher, dmitri, ivanovsky, martinus, beijerinck, in, dmitri, ivanovsky, showed, that, a, disease, of, tobacco, plant, tobacco, mosaic, disease, wa, caused, by, an, extremely, minuscule, infectious, agent, capable, of, passing, through, porcelain, chamberland, filter, something, which, bacteria, could, never, do, he, described, his, finding, in, an, article, and, a, dissertation, in, martinus, beijerinck, repeated, ivanovski, work, but, went, further, and, passed, the, filterable, agent, from, plant, to, plant, found, the, action, undiminished, and, concluded, it, in, the, thus, not, a, mere, toxin, he, called, it, contagium, vivum, fluidum, the, question, of, whether, the, agent, wa, a, living, fluid, or, a, particle, wa, however, still, open, in, it, wa, suggested, for, the, first, time, that, transduction, by, virus, might, cause, cancer, in, bang, and, ellerman, showed, that, a, filterable, virus, could, transmit, chicken, leukemia, data, largely, ignored, till, the, when, leukemia, became, regarded, a, cancerous, in, peyton, rous, reported, the, transmission, of, chicken, sarcoma, a, solid, tumor, with, a, virus, and, thus, rous, became, father, of, tumor, virology, the, virus, wa, later, called, rous, sarcoma, virus, and, understood, to, be, a, retrovirus, several, other, retrovirus, have, since, been, described, the, existence, of, virus, that, infect, bacteria, bacteriophage, wa, first, recognized, by, frederick, twort, in, and, independently, by, in, a, bacteria, could, be, grown, easily, in, culture, this, led, to, an, explosion, of, virology, research, the, cause, of, the, devastating, spanish, flu, pandemic, of, wa, initially, unclear, in, late, french, scientist, showed, that, a, virus, could, transmit, the, disease, to, people, and, animal, fulfilling, koch, postulate, in, it, wa, shown, that, scarlet, fever, is, caused, by, a, bacterium, that, is, infected, by, a, certain, bacteriophage, while, plant, virus, and, bacteriophage, can, be, grown, comparatively, easily, animal, virus, normally, require, a, living, host, animal, which, complicates, their, study, immensely, in, it, wa, shown, that, influenza, virus, could, be, grown, in, fertilized, chicken, egg, a, method, that, is, still, used, today, to, produce, vaccine, in, max, theiler, managed, to, grow, the, yellow, fever, virus, in, chicken, egg, and, produced, a, vaccine, from, an, attenuated, virus, strain, this, vaccine, saved, million, of, life, and, is, still, being, used, today, max, an, important, investigator, in, the, area, of, bacteriophage, described, the, basic, life, cycle, of, a, virus, in, rather, than, growing, a, virus, particle, is, assembled, from, it, constituent, piece, in, one, step, eventually, it, leaf, the, host, cell, to, infect, other, cell, the, experiment, in, showed, that, only, dna, and, not, protein, enters, a, bacterial, cell, upon, infection, with, bacteriophage, transduction, of, bacteria, by, bacteriophage, wa, first, described, in, the, same, year, in, john, enders, thomas, weller, and, frederick, robbins, reported, growth, of, poliovirus, in, cultured, human, embryonal, cell, the, first, significant, example, of, an, animal, virus, grown, outside, of, animal, or, chicken, egg, this, work, aided, jonas, salk, in, deriving, a, polio, vaccine, from, deactivated, polio, virus, this, vaccine, wa, shown, to, be, effective, in, the, first, virus, that, could, be, crystalized, and, whose, structure, could, therefore, be, elucidated, in, detail, wa, tobacco, mosaic, virus, tmv, the, virus, that, had, been, studied, earlier, by, ivanovski, and, beijerink, in, wendell, stanley, achieved, it, crystallization, for, electron, microscopy, and, showed, that, it, remains, active, even, after, crystallization, clear, diffraction, picture, of, the, crystallized, virus, were, obtained, by, bernal, and, fankuchen, in, based, on, such, picture, rosalind, franklin, proposed, the, full, structure, of, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, in, also, in, heinz, and, robley, williams, showed, that, purified, tmv, rna, and, it, capsid, coat, protein, can, into, functional, virion, suggesting, that, this, assembly, mechanism, is, also, used, within, the, host, cell, a, had, proposed, earlier, in, the, hepatitis, b, virus, wa, discovered, by, baruch, blumberg, who, went, on, to, develop, a, hepatitis, b, vaccine, in, howard, temin, described, the, first, retrovirus, a, virus, whose, rna, genome, wa, reverse, transcribed, into, complementary, dna, cdna, then, integrated, into, the, host, genome, and, expressed, from, that, template, the, viral, enzyme, reverse, transcriptase, which, along, with, integrase, is, a, distinguishing, trait, of, retrovirus, wa, first, described, in, independently, by, howard, temin, and, david, baltimore, the, first, retrovirus, infecting, human, wa, identified, by, robert, gallo, in, later, it, wa, found, that, reverse, transcriptase, is, not, specific, to, retrovirus, retrotransposons, which, code, for, reverse, transcriptase, are, abundant, in, the, genome, of, all, eukaryote, about, of, the, human, genome, derives, from, such, retrotransposons, in, the, functioning, of, oncoviruses, wa, clarified, considerably, until, that, time, it, wa, thought, that, these, virus, carried, certain, gene, called, oncogene, which, when, inserted, into, the, host, genome, would, cause, cancer, michael, bishop, and, harold, varmus, showed, that, the, oncogene, of, rous, sarcoma, virus, is, in, fact, not, specific, to, the, virus, but, is, contained, in, the, genome, of, healthy, animal, of, many, specie, the, oncovirus, can, switch, this, benign, on, turning, it, into, a, true, oncogene, that, cause, cancer, saw, the, first, recorded, outbreak, of, ebola, virus, disease, a, highly, lethal, virally, transmitted, disease, in, frederick, sanger, achieved, the, first, complete, sequencing, of, the, genome, of, any, organism, the, bacteriophage, phi, x, in, the, same, year, richard, robert, and, phillip, sharp, independently, showed, that, the, gene, of, adenovirus, contain, intron, and, therefore, require, gene, splicing, it, wa, later, realized, that, almost, all, gene, of, eukaryote, have, intron, a, well, a, worldwide, vaccination, campaign, led, by, the, un, world, health, organization, resulted, in, the, eradication, of, smallpox, in, in, stanley, prusiner, discovered, prion, and, showed, that, they, cause, scrapie, the, first, case, of, aid, were, reported, in, and, hiv, the, retrovirus, causing, it, wa, identified, in, by, luc, montagnier, and, robert, gallo, test, detecting, hiv, infection, by, detecting, the, presence, of, hiv, antibody, were, developed, subsequent, tremendous, research, effort, turned, hiv, into, the, best, studied, virus, human, herpes, virus, the, cause, of, kaposi, sarcoma, which, is, often, seen, in, aid, patient, wa, identified, in, several, antiretroviral, drug, were, developed, in, the, late, decreasing, aid, mortality, dramatically, in, developed, country, the, hepatitis, c, virus, wa, identified, using, novel, molecular, cloning, technique, in, leading, to, screening, test, that, dramatically, reduced, the, incidence, of, hepatitis, the, first, attempt, at, gene, therapy, involving, viral, vector, began, in, the, early, when, retrovirus, were, developed, that, could, insert, a, foreign, gene, into, the, host, genome, they, contained, the, foreign, gene, but, did, not, contain, the, viral, genome, and, therefore, could, not, reproduce, test, in, mouse, were, followed, by, test, in, human, beginning, in, the, first, human, study, attempted, to, correct, the, genetic, disease, severe, combined, immunodeficiency, scid, but, clinical, success, wa, limited, in, the, period, from, to, gene, therapy, wa, tried, on, several, other, disease, and, with, different, viral, vector, but, it, became, clear, that, the, initially, high, expectation, were, overstated, in, a, further, setback, occurred, when, jesse, gelsinger, died, in, a, gene, therapy, trial, he, suffered, a, severe, immune, response, after, having, received, an, adenovirus, vector, success, in, the, gene,

laboratory, in, main, article, history, of, virology, and, social, history, of, virus, louis, pasteur, wa, unable, to, find, a, causative, agent, for, rabies, and, speculated, about, a, pathogen, too, small, to, be, detected, using, a, microscope, in, the, french, microbiologist, charles, chamberland, invented, a, filter, known, today, a, the, chamberland, filter, or, filter, with, pore, smaller, than, bacteria, thus, he, could, pas, a, solution, containing, bacteria, through, the, filter, and, completely, remove, them, from, the, solution, in, the, russian, biologist, dmitri, ivanovsky, used, this, filter, to, study, what, is, now, known, a, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, his, experiment, showed, that, crushed, leaf, extract, from, infected, tobacco, plant, remain, infectious, after, filtration, ivanovsky, suggested, the, infection, might, be, caused, by, a, toxin, produced, by, bacteria, but, did, not, pursue, the, idea, at, the, time, it, wa, thought, that, all, infectious, agent, could, be, retained, by, filter, and, grown, on, a, nutrient, medium, this, wa, part, of, the, germ, theory, of, disease, in, the, dutch, microbiologist, martinus, beijerinck, repeated, the, experiment, and, became, convinced, that, the, filtered, solution, contained, a, new, form, of, infectious, agent, he, observed, that, the, agent, multiplied, only, in, cell, that, were, dividing, but, a, his, experiment, did, not, show, that, it, wa, made, of, particle, he, called, it, a, contagium, vivum, fluidum, soluble, living, germ, and, the, word, virus, beijerinck, maintained, that, virus, were, liquid, in, nature, a, theory, later, discredited, by, wendell, stanley, who, proved, they, were, particulate, in, the, same, year, friedrich, loeffler, and, paul, frosch, passed, the, first, animal, virus, agent, of, disease, aphthovirus, through, a, similar, filter, in, the, early, century, the, english, bacteriologist, frederick, twort, discovered, a, group, of, virus, that, infect, bacteria, now, called, bacteriophage, or, commonly, phage, and, the, microbiologist, described, virus, that, when, added, to, bacteria, on, agar, would, produce, area, of, dead, bacteria, he, accurately, diluted, a, suspension, of, these, virus, and, discovered, that, the, highest, dilution, lowest, virus, concentration, rather, than, killing, all, the, bacteria, formed, discrete, area, of, dead, organism, counting, these, area, and, multiplying, by, the, dilution, factor, allowed, him, to, calculate, the, number, of, virus, in, the, original, suspension, phage, were, heralded, a, a, potential, treatment, for, disease, such, a, typhoid, and, cholera, but, their, promise, wa, forgotten, with, the, development, of, penicillin, the, study, of, phage, provided, insight, into, the, switching, on, and, off, of, gene, and, a, useful, mechanism, for, introducing, foreign, gene, into, bacteria, by, the, end, of, the, century, virus, were, defined, in, term, of, their, infectivity, their, ability, to, be, filtered, and, their, requirement, for, living, host, virus, had, been, grown, only, in, plant, and, animal, in, ross, granville, harrison, invented, a, method, for, growing, tissue, in, lymph, and, in, steinhardt, israeli, and, lambert, used, this, method, to, grow, vaccinia, virus, in, fragment, of, guinea, pig, corneal, tissue, in, maitland, and, maitland, grew, vaccinia, virus, in, suspension, of, minced, hen, kidney, their, method, wa, not, widely, adopted, until, the, when, poliovirus, wa, grown, on, a, large, scale, for, vaccine, production, another, breakthrough, came, in, when, the, american, pathologist, ernest, william, goodpasture, grew, influenza, and, several, other, virus, in, fertilized, chicken, egg, in, john, franklin, enders, thomas, weller, and, frederick, robbins, grew, polio, virus, in, cultured, human, embryo, cell, the, first, virus, to, be, grown, without, using, solid, animal, tissue, or, egg, this, work, enabled, jonas, salk, to, make, an, effective, polio, vaccine, the, first, image, of, virus, were, obtained, upon, the, invention, of, electron, microscopy, in, by, the, german, engineer, ernst, ruska, and, max, knoll, in, american, biochemist, and, virologist, wendell, meredith, stanley, examined, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, and, found, it, wa, mostly, made, of, protein, a, short, time, later, this, virus, wa, separated, into, protein, and, rna, part, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, wa, the, first, to, be, crystallised, and, it, structure, could, therefore, be, elucidated, in, detail, the, first, diffraction, picture, of, the, crystallised, virus, were, obtained, by, bernal, and, fankuchen, in, on, the, basis, of, her, picture, rosalind, franklin, discovered, the, full, structure, of, the, virus, in, in, the, same, year, heinz, and, robley, williams, showed, that, purified, tobacco, mosaic, virus, rna, and, it, protein, coat, can, assemble, by, themselves, to, form, functional, virus, suggesting, that, this, simple, mechanism, wa, probably, the, mean, through, which, virus, were, created, within, their, host, cell, the, second, half, of, the, century, wa, the, golden, age, of, virus, discovery, and, most, of, the, over, recognised, specie, of, animal, plant, and, bacterial, virus, were, discovered, during, these, year, in, equine, arterivirus, and, the, cause, of, bovine, virus, diarrhea, a, pestivirus, were, discovered, in, the, hepatitis, b, virus, wa, discovered, by, baruch, blumberg, and, in, howard, temin, described, the, first, retrovirus, reverse, transcriptase, the, enzyme, that, retrovirus, use, to, make, dna, copy, of, their, rna, wa, first, described, in, independently, by, howard, martin, temin, and, david, baltimore, in, luc, montagnier, team, at, the, pasteur, institute, in, france, first, isolated, the, retrovirus, now, called, hiv, origin, see, also, evolution, of, virus, virus, are, found, wherever, there, is, life, and, have, probably, existed, since, living, cell, first, evolved, the, origin, of, virus, is, unclear, because, they, do, not, form, fossil, so, molecular, technique, have, been, used, to, compare, the, dna, or, rna, of, virus, and, are, a, useful, mean, of, investigating, how, they, arose, in, addition, viral, genetic, material, may, occasionally, integrate, into, germline, of, the, host, organism, by, which, they, can, be, passed, on, vertically, to, offspring, of, the, host, for, many, generation, this, provides, an, invaluable, source, of, information, for, paleovirologist, to, trace, back, ancient, virus, that, have, existed, up, to, million, of, year, ago, currently, there, are, three, main, hypothesis, that, aim, to, explain, the, origin, of, virus, regressive, hypothesis, virus, may, have, once, been, small, cell, that, parasitised, larger, cell, over, time, gene, not, required, by, their, parasitism, were, lost, the, bacteria, rickettsia, and, chlamydia, are, living, cell, that, like, virus, can, reproduce, only, inside, host, cell, they, lend, support, to, this, hypothesis, a, their, dependence, on, parasitism, is, likely, to, have, caused, the, loss, of, gene, that, enabled, them, to, survive, outside, a, cell, this, is, also, called, the, degeneracy, hypothesis, or, reduction, hypothesis, cellular, origin, hypothesis, some, virus, may, have, evolved, from, bit, of, dna, or, rna, that, escaped, from, the, gene, of, a, larger, organism, the, escaped, dna, could, have, come, from, plasmid, piece, of, naked, dna, that, can, move, between, cell, or, transposon, molecule, of, dna, that, replicate, and, move, around, to, different, position, within, the, gene, of, the, cell, once, called, jumping, gene, transposon, are, example, of, mobile, genetic, element, and, could, be, the, origin, of, some, virus, they, were, discovered, in, maize, by, barbara, mcclintock, in, this, is, sometimes, called, the, vagrancy, hypothesis, or, the, escape, hypothesis, coevolution, hypothesis, this, is, also, called, the, hypothesis, and, proposes, that, virus, may, have, evolved, from, complex, molecule, of, protein, and, nucleic, acid, at, the, same, time, a, cell, first, appeared, on, earth, and, would, have, been, dependent, on, cellular, life, for, billion, of, year, viroid, are, molecule, of, rna, that, are, not, classified, a, virus, because, they, lack, a, protein, coat, however, they, have, characteristic, that, are, common, to, several, virus, and, are, often, called, subviral, agent, viroid, are, important, pathogen, of, plant, they, do, not, code, for, protein, but, interact, with, the, host, cell, and, use, the, host, machinery, for, their, replication, the, hepatitis, delta, virus, of, human, ha, an, rna, genome, similar, to, viroid, but, ha, a, protein, coat, derived, from, hepatitis, b, virus, and, can, not, produce, one, of, it, own, it, is, therefore, a, defective, virus, although, hepatitis, delta, virus, genome, may, replicate, independently, once, inside, a, host, cell, it, requires, the, help, of, hepatitis, b, virus, to, provide, a, protein, coat, so, that, it, can, be, transmitted, to, new, cell, in, similar, manner, the, sputnik, virophage, is, dependent, on, mimivirus, which, infects, the, protozoan, acanthamoeba, castellanii, these, virus, which, are, dependent, on, the, presence, of, other, virus, specie, in, the, host, cell, are, called, satellite, and, may, represent, evolutionary, intermediate, of, viroid, and, virus, in, the, past, there, were, problem, with, all, of, these, hypothesis, the, regressive, hypothesis, did, not, explain, why, even, the, smallest, of, cellular, parasite, do, not, resemble, virus, in, any, way, the, escape, hypothesis, did, not, explain, the, complex, capsid, and, other, structure, on, virus, particle, the, hypothesis, contravened, the, definition, of, virus, in, that, they, require, host, cell, virus, are, now, recognised, a, ancient, and, a, having, origin, that, the, divergence, of, life, into, the, three, domain, this, discovery, ha, led, modern, virologist, to, reconsider, and, these, three, classical, hypothesis, the, evidence, for, an, ancestral, world, of, rna, cell, and, computer, analysis, of, viral, and, host, dna, sequence, are, giving, a, better, understanding, of, the, evolutionary, relationship, between, different, virus, and, may, help, identify, the, ancestor, of, modern, virus, to, date, such, analysis, have, not, proved, which, of, these, hypothesis, is, correct, however, it, seems, unlikely, that, all, currently, known, virus, have, a, common, ancestor, and, virus, have, probably, arisen, numerous, time, in, the, past, by, one, or, more, mechanism, prion, are, infectious, protein, molecule, that, do, not, contain, dna, or, rna, they, can, cause, infection, such, a, scrapie, in, sheep, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, mad, cow, disease, in, cattle, and, chronic, wasting, disease, in, deer, in, human, prionic, disease, include, kuru, disease, and, syndrome, although, prion, are, fundamentally, different, from, virus, and, viroid, their, discovery, give, credence, to, the, theory, that, virus, could, have, evolved, from, molecule, microbiology, life, property, opinion, differ, on, whether, virus, are, a, form, of, life, or, organic, structure, that, interact, with, living, organism, they, have, been, described, a, organism, at, the, edge, of, life, since, they, resemble, organism, in, that, they, posse, gene, and, evolve, by, natural, selection, and, reproduce, by, creating, multiple, copy, of, themselves, through, although, they, have, gene, they, do, not, have, a, cellular, structure, which, is, often, seen, a, the, basic, unit, of, life, virus, do, not, have, their, own, metabolism, and, require, a, host, cell, to, make, new, product, they, therefore, can, not, naturally, reproduce, outside, a, host, cell, although, bacterial, specie, such, a, rickettsia, and, chlamydia, are, considered, living, organism, despite, the, same, limitation, accepted, form, of, life, use, cell, division, to, reproduce, whereas, virus, spontaneously, assemble, within, cell, they, differ, from, autonomous, growth, of, crystal, a, they, inherit, genetic, mutation, while, being, subject, to, natural, selection, virus, within, host, cell, ha, implication, for, the, study, of, the, origin, of, life, a, it, lends, further, credence, to, the, hypothesis, that, life, could, have, started, a, organic, molecule, structure, diagram, of, how, a, virus, capsid, can, be, constructed, using, multiple, copy, of, just, two, protein, molecule, structure, of, icosahedral, cowpea, mosaic, virus, virus, display, a, wide, diversity, of, shape, and, size, called, morphology, in, general, virus, are, much, smaller, than, bacteria, most, virus, that, have, been, studied, have, a, diameter, between, and, nanometre, some, filovirus, have, a, total, length, of, up, to, nm, their, diameter, are, only, about, nm, most, virus, can, not, be, seen, with, an, optical, microscope, so, scanning, and, transmission, electron, microscope, are, used, to, visualise, virion, to, increase, the, contrast, between, virus, and, the, background, stain, are, used, these, are, solution, of, salt, of, heavy, metal, such, a, tungsten, that, scatter, the, electron, from, region, covered, with, the, stain, when, virion, are, coated, with, stain, positive, staining, fine, detail, is, obscured, negative, staining, overcomes, this, problem, by, staining, the, background, only, a, complete, virus, particle, known, a, a, virion, consists, of, nucleic, acid, surrounded, by, a, protective, coat, of, protein, called, a, capsid, these, are, formed, from, identical, protein, subunit, called, capsomeres, virus, can, have, a, lipid, envelope, derived, from, the, host, cell, membrane, the, capsid, is, made, from, protein, encoded, by, the, viral, genome, and, it, shape, serf, a, the, basis, for, morphological, distinction, virally, coded, protein, subunit, will, to, form, a, capsid, in, general, requiring, the, presence, of, the, virus, genome, complex, virus, code, for, protein, that, assist, in, the, construction, of, their, capsid, protein, associated, with, nucleic, acid, are, known, a, nucleoprotein, and, the, association, of, viral, capsid, protein, with, viral, nucleic, acid, is, called, a, nucleocapsid, the, capsid, and, entire, virus, structure, can, be, mechanically, physically, probed, through, atomic, force, microscopy, in, general, there, are, four, main, morphological, virus, type, structure, of, tobacco, mosaic, virus, rna, coiled, in, a, helix, of, repeating, protein, electron, micrograph, of, icosahedral, adenovirus, with, a, cartoon, to, demonstrate, it, icosahedral, structure, herpes, virus, have, a, lipid, envelope, helical, these, virus, are, composed, of, a, single, type, of, capsomer, stacked, around, a, central, axis, to, form, a, helical, structure, which, may, have, a, central, cavity, or, tube, this, arrangement, result, in, or, filamentous, virion, these, can, be, short, and, highly, rigid, or, long, and, very, flexible, the, genetic, material, in, general, rna, but, ssdna, in, some, case, is, bound, into, the, protein, helix, by, interaction, between, the, negatively, charged, nucleic, acid, and, positive, charge, on, the, protein, overall, the, length, of, a, helical, capsid, is, related, to, the, length, of, the, nucleic, acid, contained, within, it, and, the, diameter, is, dependent, on, the, size, and, arrangement, of, capsomers, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, is, an, example, of, a, helical, virus, icosahedral, most, animal, virus, are, icosahedral, or, with, icosahedral, symmetry, a, regular, icosahedron, is, the, optimum, way, of, forming, a, closed, shell, from, identical, the, minimum, number, of, identical, capsomers, required, is, twelve, each, composed, of, five, identical, many, virus, such, a, rotavirus, have, more, than, twelve, capsomers, and, appear, spherical, but, they, retain, this, symmetry, capsomers, at, the, apex, are, surrounded, by, five, other, capsomers, and, are, called, pentons, capsomers, on, the, triangular, face, are, surrounded, by, six, others, and, are, called, hexons, hexons, are, in, essence, flat, and, pentons, which, form, the, vertex, are, curved, the, same, protein, may, act, a, the, subunit, of, both, the, pentamers, and, hexamers, or, they, may, be, composed, of, different, protein, prolate, this, is, an, icosahedron, elongated, along, the, fivefold, axis, and, is, a, common, arrangement, of, the, head, of, bacteriophage, this, structure, is, composed, of, a, cylinder, with, a, cap, at, either, end, envelope, some, specie, of, virus, envelop, themselves, in, a,

measuring, nm, project, from, the, surface, the, capsid, appears, hexagonal, under, an, electron, microscope, therefore, the, capsid, is, probably, icosahedral, in, researcher, discovered, the, largest, then, known, virus, in, sample, of, water, collected, from, the, ocean, floor, off, the, coast, of, la, crux, chile, provisionally, named, megavirus, chilensis, it, can, be, seen, with, a, basic, optical, microscope, in, the, pandoravirus, genus, wa, discovered, in, chile, and, australia, and, ha, genome, about, twice, a, large, a, megavirus, and, mimivirus, some, virus, that, infect, archaea, have, complex, structure, that, are, unrelated, to, any, other, form, of, virus, with, a, wide, variety, of, unusual, shape, ranging, from, structure, to, virus, that, resemble, hooked, rod, teardrop, or, even, bottle, other, archaeal, virus, resemble, the, tailed, bacteriophage, and, can, have, multiple, tail, structure, genome, genomic, diversity, among, virus, property, parameter, nucleic, acid, dna, rna, both, dna, and, rna, at, different, stage, in, the, life, cycle, shape, linear, circular, segmented, strandedness, with, region, of, sense, positive, sense, negative, sense, ambisense, an, enormous, variety, of, genomic, structure, can, be, seen, among, viral, specie, a, a, group, they, contain, more, structural, genomic, diversity, than, plant, animal, archaea, or, bacteria, there, are, million, of, different, type, of, virus, although, only, about, of, them, have, been, described, in, detail, a, virus, ha, either, a, dna, or, an, rna, genome, and, is, called, a, dna, virus, or, an, rna, virus, respectively, the, vast, majority, of, virus, have, rna, genome, plant, virus, tend, to, have, rna, genome, and, bacteriophage, tend, to, have, dna, genome, viral, genome, are, circular, a, in, the, polyomaviruses, or, linear, a, in, the, adenovirus, the, type, of, nucleic, acid, is, irrelevant, to, the, shape, of, the, genome, among, rna, virus, and, certain, dna, virus, the, genome, is, often, divided, up, into, separate, part, in, which, case, it, is, called, segmented, for, rna, virus, each, segment, often, code, for, only, one, protein, and, they, are, usually, found, together, in, one, capsid, however, all, segment, are, not, required, to, be, in, the, same, virion, for, the, virus, to, be, infectious, a, demonstrated, by, brome, mosaic, virus, and, several, other, plant, virus, a, viral, genome, irrespective, of, nucleic, acid, type, is, almost, always, either, or, genome, consist, of, an, unpaired, nucleic, acid, analogous, to, of, a, ladder, split, down, the, middle, genome, consist, of, two, complementary, paired, nucleic, acid, analogous, to, a, ladder, the, virus, particle, of, some, virus, family, such, a, those, belonging, to, the, hepadnaviridae, contain, a, genome, that, is, partially, and, partially, for, most, virus, with, rna, genome, and, some, with, dna, genome, the, single, strand, are, said, to, be, either, called, the, or, called, the, depending, on, if, they, are, complementary, to, the, viral, messenger, rna, mrna, viral, rna, is, in, the, same, sense, a, viral, mrna, and, thus, at, least, a, part, of, it, can, be, immediately, translated, by, the, host, cell, viral, rna, is, complementary, to, mrna, and, thus, must, be, converted, to, rna, by, an, rna, polymerase, before, translation, dna, nomenclature, for, virus, with, genomic, ssdna, is, similar, to, rna, nomenclature, in, that, the, template, strand, for, the, viral, mrna, is, complementary, to, it, and, the, coding, strand, is, a, copy, of, it, however, several, type, of, ssdna, and, ssrna, virus, have, genome, that, are, ambisense, in, that, transcription, can, occur, off, both, strand, in, a, replicative, intermediate, example, include, geminiviruses, which, are, ssdna, plant, virus, and, arenavirus, which, are, ssrna, virus, of, animal, genome, size, varies, greatly, between, specie, the, smallest, viral, genome, the, ssdna, circoviruses, family, circoviridae, code, for, only, two, protein, and, have, a, genome, size, of, only, two, kilobases, the, genome, size, of, around, two, megabases, which, code, for, about, protein, in, general, rna, virus, have, smaller, genome, size, than, dna, virus, because, of, a, higher, when, replicating, and, have, a, maximum, upper, size, limit, beyond, this, limit, error, in, the, genome, when, replicating, render, the, virus, useless, or, uncompetitive, to, compensate, for, this, rna, virus, often, have, segmented, genome, the, genome, is, split, into, smaller, molecule, thus, reducing, the, chance, that, an, error, in, a, genome, will, incapacitate, the, entire, genome, in, contrast, dna, virus, generally, have, larger, genome, because, of, the, high, fidelity, of, their, replication, enzyme, dna, virus, are, an, exception, to, this, rule, however, a, mutation, rate, for, these, genome, can, approach, the, extreme, of, the, ssrna, virus, case, genetic, mutation, how, antigenic, shift, or, reassortment, can, result, in, novel, and, highly, pathogenic, strain, of, human, flu, virus, undergo, genetic, change, by, several, mechanism, these, include, a, process, called, antigenic, drift, where, individual, base, in, the, dna, or, rna, mutate, to, other, base, most, of, these, point, mutation, are, silent, they, do, not, change, the, protein, that, the, gene, encodes, but, others, can, confer, evolutionary, advantage, such, a, resistance, to, antiviral, drug, antigenic, shift, occurs, when, there, is, a, major, change, in, the, genome, of, the, virus, this, can, be, a, result, of, recombination, or, reassortment, when, this, happens, with, influenza, virus, pandemic, might, result, rna, virus, often, exist, a, quasispecies, or, swarm, of, virus, of, the, same, specie, but, with, slightly, different, genome, nucleoside, sequence, such, quasispecies, are, a, prime, target, for, natural, selection, segmented, genome, confer, evolutionary, advantage, different, strain, of, a, virus, with, a, segmented, genome, can, shuffle, and, combine, gene, and, produce, progeny, virus, or, offspring, that, have, unique, characteristic, this, is, called, reassortment, or, viral, sex, genetic, recombination, is, the, process, by, which, a, strand, of, dna, is, broken, and, then, joined, to, the, end, of, a, different, dna, molecule, this, can, occur, when, virus, infect, cell, simultaneously, and, study, of, viral, evolution, have, shown, that, recombination, ha, been, rampant, in, the, specie, studied, recombination, is, common, to, both, rna, and, dna, virus, replication, cycle, viral, population, do, not, grow, through, cell, division, because, they, are, acellular, instead, they, use, the, machinery, and, metabolism, of, a, host, cell, to, produce, multiple, copy, of, themselves, and, they, assemble, in, the, cell, a, typical, virus, replication, cycle, some, bacteriophage, inject, their, genome, into, bacterial, cell, not, to, scale, the, life, cycle, of, virus, differs, greatly, between, specie, but, there, are, six, basic, stage, in, the, life, cycle, of, virus, attachment, is, a, specific, binding, between, viral, capsid, protein, and, specific, receptor, on, the, host, cellular, surface, this, specificity, determines, the, host, range, of, a, virus, for, example, hiv, infects, a, limited, range, of, human, leucocyte, this, is, because, it, surface, protein, specifically, interacts, with, the, molecule, a, chemokine, receptor, which, is, most, commonly, found, on, the, surface, of, this, mechanism, ha, evolved, to, favour, those, virus, that, infect, only, cell, in, which, they, are, capable, of, replication, attachment, to, the, receptor, can, induce, the, viral, envelope, protein, to, undergo, change, that, result, in, the, fusion, of, viral, and, cellular, membrane, or, change, of, virus, surface, protein, that, allow, the, virus, to, enter, penetration, follows, attachment, virion, enter, the, host, cell, through, endocytosis, or, membrane, fusion, this, is, often, called, viral, entry, the, infection, of, plant, and, fungal, cell, is, different, from, that, of, animal, cell, plant, have, a, rigid, cell, wall, made, of, cellulose, and, fungi, one, of, chitin, so, most, virus, can, get, inside, these, cell, only, after, trauma, to, the, cell, wall, however, nearly, all, plant, virus, such, a, tobacco, mosaic, virus, can, also, move, directly, from, cell, to, cell, in, the, form, of, nucleoprotein, complex, through, pore, called, plasmodesmata, bacteria, like, plant, have, strong, cell, wall, that, a, virus, must, breach, to, infect, the, cell, however, given, that, bacterial, cell, wall, are, much, le, thick, than, plant, cell, wall, due, to, their, much, smaller, size, some, virus, have, evolved, mechanism, that, inject, their, genome, into, the, bacterial, cell, across, the, cell, wall, while, the, viral, capsid, remains, outside, uncoating, is, a, process, in, which, the, viral, capsid, is, removed, this, may, be, by, degradation, by, viral, enzyme, or, host, enzyme, or, by, simple, dissociation, the, is, the, releasing, of, the, viral, genomic, nucleic, acid, replication, of, virus, involves, primarily, multiplication, of, the, genome, replication, involves, synthesis, of, viral, messenger, rna, mrna, from, early, gene, with, exception, for, positive, sense, rna, virus, viral, protein, synthesis, possible, assembly, of, viral, protein, then, viral, genome, replication, mediated, by, early, or, regulatory, protein, expression, this, may, be, followed, for, complex, virus, with, larger, genome, by, one, or, more, further, round, of, mrna, synthesis, late, gene, expression, is, in, general, of, structural, or, virion, protein, assembly, following, the, of, the, virus, particle, some, modification, of, the, protein, often, occurs, in, virus, such, a, hiv, this, modification, sometimes, called, maturation, occurs, after, the, virus, ha, been, released, from, the, host, cell, release, virus, can, be, released, from, the, host, cell, by, lysis, a, process, that, kill, the, cell, by, bursting, it, membrane, and, cell, wall, if, present, this, is, a, feature, of, many, bacterial, and, some, animal, virus, some, virus, undergo, a, lysogenic, cycle, where, the, viral, genome, is, incorporated, by, genetic, recombination, into, a, specific, place, in, the, host, chromosome, the, viral, genome, is, then, known, a, a, provirus, or, in, the, case, of, bacteriophage, a, prophage, whenever, the, host, divide, the, viral, genome, is, also, replicated, the, viral, genome, is, mostly, silent, within, the, host, however, at, some, point, the, provirus, or, prophage, may, give, rise, to, active, virus, which, may, lyse, the, host, cell, enveloped, virus, hiv, typically, are, released, from, the, host, cell, by, budding, during, this, process, the, virus, acquires, it, envelope, which, is, a, modified, piece, of, the, host, plasma, or, other, internal, membrane, the, genetic, material, within, virus, particle, and, the, method, by, which, the, material, is, replicated, varies, considerably, between, different, type, of, virus, dna, virus, the, genome, replication, of, most, dna, virus, take, place, in, the, cell, nucleus, if, the, cell, ha, the, appropriate, receptor, on, it, surface, these, virus, enter, the, cell, sometimes, by, direct, fusion, with, the, cell, membrane, herpesviruses, or, more, usually, by, endocytosis, most, dna, virus, are, entirely, dependent, on, the, host, cell, dna, and, rna, synthesising, machinery, and, rna, processing, machinery, however, virus, with, larger, genome, may, encode, much, of, this, machinery, themselves, in, eukaryote, the, viral, genome, must, cross, the, cell, nuclear, membrane, to, access, this, machinery, while, in, bacteria, it, need, only, enter, the, cell, rna, virus, replication, usually, take, place, in, the, cytoplasm, rna, virus, can, be, placed, into, four, different, group, depending, on, their, mode, of, replication, the, polarity, whether, or, not, it, can, be, used, directly, by, ribosome, to, make, protein, of, rna, virus, largely, determines, the, replicative, mechanism, the, other, major, criterion, is, whether, the, genetic, material, is, or, all, rna, virus, use, their, own, rna, replicase, enzyme, to, create, copy, of, their, genome, reverse, transcribing, virus, these, have, ssrna, retroviridae, metaviridae, pseudoviridae, or, dsdna, caulimoviridae, and, hepadnaviridae, in, their, particle, reverse, transcribing, virus, with, rna, genome, retrovirus, use, a, dna, intermediate, to, replicate, whereas, those, with, dna, genome, pararetroviruses, use, an, rna, intermediate, during, genome, replication, both, type, use, a, reverse, transcriptase, or, dna, polymerase, enzyme, to, carry, out, the, nucleic, acid, conversion, retrovirus, integrate, the, dna, produced, by, reverse, transcription, into, the, host, genome, a, a, provirus, a, a, part, of, the, replication, process, pararetroviruses, do, not, although, integrated, genome, copy, of, especially, plant, pararetroviruses, can, give, rise, to, infectious, virus, they, are, susceptible, to, antiviral, drug, that, inhibit, the, reverse, transcriptase, enzyme, zidovudine, and, lamivudine, an, example, of, the, first, type, is, hiv, which, is, a, retrovirus, example, of, the, second, type, are, the, hepadnaviridae, which, includes, hepatitis, b, virus, effect, on, the, host, cell, the, range, of, structural, and, biochemical, effect, that, virus, have, on, the, host, cell, is, extensive, these, are, called, cytopathic, effect, most, virus, infection, eventually, result, in, the, death, of, the, host, cell, the, cause, of, death, include, cell, lysis, alteration, to, the, cell, surface, membrane, and, apoptosis, often, cell, death, is, caused, by, cessation, of, it, normal, activity, because, of, suppression, by, protein, not, all, of, which, are, component, of, the, virus, particle, some, virus, cause, no, apparent, change, to, the, infected, cell, cell, in, which, the, virus, is, latent, and, inactive, show, few, sign, of, infection, and, often, function, normally, this, cause, persistent, infection, and, the, virus, is, often, dormant, for, many, month, or, year, this, is, often, the, case, with, herpes, virus, some, virus, such, a, virus, can, cause, cell, to, proliferate, without, causing, malignancy, while, others, such, a, papillomaviruses, are, established, cause, of, cancer, host, range, virus, are, by, far, the, most, abundant, biological, entity, on, earth, and, they, outnumber, all, the, others, put, together, they, infect, all, type, of, cellular, life, including, animal, plant, bacteria, and, fungi, however, different, type, of, virus, can, infect, only, a, limited, range, of, host, and, many, are, some, such, a, smallpox, virus, for, example, can, infect, only, one, specie, in, this, case, human, and, are, said, to, have, a, narrow, host, range, other, virus, such, a, rabies, virus, can, infect, different, specie, of, mammal, and, are, said, to, have, a, broad, range, the, virus, that, infect, plant, are, harmless, to, animal, and, most, virus, that, infect, other, animal, are, harmless, to, human, the, host, range, of, some, bacteriophage, is, limited, to, a, single, strain, of, bacteria, and, they, can, be, used, to, trace, the, source, of, outbreak, of, infection, by, a, method, called, phage, typing, classification, main, article, virus, classification, classification, seek, to, describe, the, diversity, of, virus, by, naming, and, grouping, them, on, the, basis, of, similarity, in, lwoff, robert, horne, and, paul, tournier, were, the, first, to, develop, a, mean, of, virus, classification, based, on, the, linnaean, hierarchical, system, this, system, base, classification, on, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and, specie, virus, were, grouped, according, to, their, shared, property, not, those, of, their, host, and, the, type, of, nucleic, acid, forming, their, genome, later, the, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, virus, wa, formed, however, virus, are, not, classified, on, the, basis, of, phylum, or, class, a, their, small, genome, size, and, high, rate, of, mutation, make, it, difficult, to, determine, their, ancestry, beyond, order, a, such, the, baltimore, classification, is, used, to, supplement, the, more, traditional, hierarchy, ictv, classification, the, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, virus, ictv, developed, the, current, classification, system, and, wrote, guideline, that, put, a, greater, weight, on, certain, virus, property, to, maintain, family, uniformity, a, unified, taxonomy, a, universal, system, for, classifying, virus, ha, been, established, the, lctv, report, defines, the, concept, of, the, virus, specie, a, the, lowest, taxon, group, in, a, branching, hierarchy, of, viral, taxon, however, at, present, only, a, small, part, of, the, total, diversity, of, virus, ha, been, studied, with, analysis, of, sample, from, human, finding, that, about, of, the, virus, sequence, recovered, have, not, been, seen, before, and, sample, from, the, environment, such, a, from, seawater, and, ocean, sediment, finding, that, the, large, majority, of, sequence, are, completely, novel, the, general, taxonomic, structure, is, a, follows, order, family, subfamily, genus, specie, in, the, current, ictv, taxonomy, order, have, been, established, the, caudovirales, herpesvirales, ligamenvirales, mononegavirales, nidovirales, picornavirales, and, tymovirales, the, committee, doe, not, formally, distinguish, between, subspecies, strain, and, isolates, in, total, there, are, order, family, subfamily, genus, about, specie, and, over, type, yet, unclassified, baltimore, classification, the, baltimore, classification, of, virus, is, based, on, the, method, of, viral, mrna, synthesis, main, article, baltimore, classification, the, nobel, biologist, david, baltimore, devised, the, baltimore, classification, system, the, ictv, classification, system, is, used, in, conjunction, with, the, baltimore, classification, system, in, modern, virus, classification, the, baltimore, classification, of, virus, is, based, on, the, mechanism, of, mrna, production, virus, must, generate, mrna, from, their, genome, to, produce, protein, and, replicate, themselves, but, different, mechanism, are, used, to, achieve, this, in, each, virus, family, viral, genome, may, be, s, or, d, rna, or, dna, and, may, or, may, not, use, reverse, transcriptase, rt, in, addition, ssrna, virus, may, be, either, sense, or, antisense, this, classification, place, virus, into, seven, group, i, dsdna, virus, adenovirus, herpesviruses, poxvirus, ii, ssdna, virus, strand, or, sense, dna, parvovirus, iii, dsrna, virus, reovirus, iv, ssrna, virus, strand, or, sense, rna, picornavirus, togaviruses, v, ssrna, virus, strand, or, antisense, rna, orthomyxovirus, rhabdovirus, vi, virus, strand, or, sense, rna, with, dna, intermediate, in, retrovirus, vii, virus, hepadnavirus, a, an, example, of, viral, classification, the, chicken, pox, virus, varicella, zoster, vzv, belongs, to, the, order, herpesvirales, family, herpesviridae, subfamily, alphaherpesvirinae, and, genus, varicellovirus, vzv, is, in, group, i, of, the, baltimore, classification, because, it, is, a, dsdna, virus, that, doe, not, use, reverse, transcriptase, role, in, human, disease, overview, of, the, main, type, of, viral, infection, and, the, most, notable, specie, involved, see, also, viral, disease, example, of, common, human, disease, caused, by, virus, include, the, common, cold, influenza, chickenpox, and, cold, sore, many, serious, disease, such, a, ebola, virus, disease, aid, avian, influenza, and, sars, are, caused, by, virus, the, relative, ability, of, virus, to, cause, disease, is, described, in, term, of, virulence, other, disease, are, under, investigation, to, discover, if, they, have, a, virus, a, the, causative, agent, such, a, the, possible, connection, between, human, herpesvirus, and, neurological, disease, such, a, multiple, sclerosis, and, chronic, fatigue, syndrome, there, is, controversy, over, whether, the, bornavirus, previously, thought, to, cause, neurological, disease, in, horse, could, be, responsible, for, psychiatric, illness, in, human, virus, have, different, mechanism, by, which, they, produce, disease, in, an, organism, which, depends, largely, on, the, viral, specie, mechanism, at, the, cellular, level, primarily, include, cell, lysis, the, breaking, open, and, subsequent, death, of, the, cell, in, multicellular, organism, if, enough, cell, die, the, whole, organism, will, start, to, suffer, the, effect, although, virus, cause, disruption, of, healthy, homeostasis, resulting, in, disease, they, may, exist, relatively, harmlessly, within, an, organism, an, example, would, include, the, ability, of, the, herpes, simplex, virus, which, cause, cold, sore, to, remain, in, a, dormant, state, within, the, human, body, this, is, called, latency, and, is, a, characteristic, of, the, herpes, virus, including, virus, which, cause, glandular, fever, and, varicella, zoster, virus, which, cause, chickenpox, and, shingle, most, people, have, been, infected, with, at, least, one, of, these, type, of, herpes, virus, however, these, latent, virus, might, sometimes, be, beneficial, a, the, presence, of, the, virus, can, increase, immunity, against, bacterial, pathogen, such, a, yersinia, pestis, some, virus, can, cause, lifelong, or, chronic, infection, where, the, virus, continue, to, replicate, in, the, body, despite, the, host, defense, mechanism, this, is, common, in, hepatitis, b, virus, and, hepatitis, c, virus, infection, people, chronically, infected, are, known, a, carrier, a, they, serve, a, reservoir, of, infectious, virus, in, population, with, a, high, proportion, of, carrier, the, disease, is, said, to, be, endemic, epidemiology, viral, epidemiology, is, the, branch, of, medical, science, that, deal, with, the, transmission, and, control, of, virus, infection, in, human, transmission, of, virus, can, be, vertical, which, mean, from, mother, to, child, or, horizontal, which, mean, from, person, to, person, example, of, vertical, transmission, include, hepatitis, b, virus, and, hiv, where, the, baby, is, born, already, infected, with, the, virus, another, more, rare, example, is, the, varicella, zoster, virus, which, although, causing, relatively, mild, infection, in, human, can, be, fatal, to, the, foetus, and, newborn, baby, horizontal, transmission, is, the, most, common, mechanism, of, spread, of, virus, in, population, transmission, can, occur, when, body, fluid, are, exchanged, during, sexual, activity, hiv, blood, is, exchanged, by, contaminated, transfusion, or, needle, sharing, hepatitis, c, exchange, of, saliva, by, mouth, virus, contaminated, food, or, water, is, ingested, norovirus, aerosol, containing, virion, are, inhaled, influenza, virus, and, insect, vector, such, a, mosquito, penetrate, the, skin, of, a, host, dengue, the, rate, or, speed, of, transmission, of, viral, infection, depends, on, factor, that, include, population, density, the, number, of, susceptible, individual, those, not, immune, the, quality, of, healthcare, and, the, weather, epidemiology, is, used, to, break, the, chain, of, infection, in, population, during, outbreak, of, viral, disease, control, measure, are, used, that, are, based, on, knowledge, of, how, the, virus, is, transmitted, it, is, important, to, find, the, source, or, source, of, the, outbreak, and, to, identify, the, virus, once, the, virus, ha, been, identified, the, chain, of, transmission, can, sometimes, be, broken, by, vaccine, when, vaccine, are, not, available, sanitation, and, disinfection, can, be, effective, often, infected, people, are, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, community, and, those, that, have, been, exposed, to, the, virus, are, placed, in, quarantine, to, control, the, outbreak, of, disease, in, cattle, in, britain, in, thousand, of, cattle, were, slaughtered, most, viral, infection, of, human, and, other, animal, have, incubation, period, during, which, the, infection, cause, no, sign, or, symptom, incubation, period, for, viral, disease, range, from, a, few, day, to, week, but, are, known, for, most, infection, somewhat, overlapping, but, mainly, following, the, incubation, period, there, is, a, period, of, communicability, a, time, when, an, infected, individual, or, animal, is, contagious, and, can, infect, another, person, or, animal, this, too, is, known, for, many, viral, infection, and, knowledge, of, the, length, of, both, period, is, important, in, the, control, of, outbreak, when, outbreak, cause, an, unusually, high, proportion, of, case, in, a, population, community, or, region, they, are, called, epidemic, if, outbreak, spread, worldwide, they, are, called, pandemic, epidemic, and, pandemic, transmission, electron, microscope, image, of, a, recreated, influenza, virus, see, also, flu, pandemic, aid, and,

occur, only, in, a, minority, of, infected, person, or, animal, cancer, virus, come, from, a, range, of, virus, family, including, both, rna, and, dna, virus, and, so, there, is, no, single, type, of, oncovirus, an, obsolete, term, originally, used, for, acutely, transforming, retrovirus, the, development, of, cancer, is, determined, by, a, variety, of, factor, such, a, host, immunity, and, mutation, in, the, host, virus, accepted, to, cause, human, cancer, include, some, genotype, of, human, papillomavirus, hepatitis, b, virus, hepatitis, c, virus, virus, kaposi, herpesvirus, and, human, virus, the, most, recently, discovered, human, cancer, virus, is, a, polyomavirus, merkel, cell, polyomavirus, that, cause, most, case, of, a, rare, form, of, skin, cancer, called, merkel, cell, carcinoma, hepatitis, virus, can, develop, into, a, chronic, viral, infection, that, lead, to, liver, cancer, infection, by, human, virus, can, lead, to, tropical, spastic, paraparesis, and,

and, mouse, polyomaviruses, that, have, been, used, a, animal, model, for, cancer, virus, for, over, year, host, defence, mechanism, see, also, immune, system, the, body, first, line, of, defence, against, virus, is, the, innate, immune, system, this, comprises, cell, and, other, mechanism, that, defend, the, host, from, infection, in, a, manner, this, mean, that, the, cell, of, the, innate, system, recognise, and, respond, to, pathogen, in, a, generic, way, but, unlike, the, adaptive, immune, system, it, doe, not, confer, or, protective, immunity, to, the, host, rna, interference, is, an, important, innate, defence, against, virus, many, virus, have, a, replication, strategy, that, involves, rna, dsrna, when, such, a, virus, infects, a, cell, it, release, it, rna, molecule, or, molecule, which, immediately, bind, to, a, protein, complex, called, a, dicer, that, cut, the, rna, into, smaller, piece, a, biochemical, pathway, the, risc, complex, is, activated, which, ensures, cell, survival, by, degrading, the, viral, mrna, rotavirus, have, evolved, to, avoid, this, defence, mechanism, by, not, uncoating, fully, inside, the, cell, and, releasing, newly, produced, mrna, through, pore, in, the, particle, inner, capsid, their, genomic, dsrna, remains, protected, inside, the, core, of, the, virion, when, the, adaptive, immune, system, of, a, vertebrate, encounter, a, virus, it, produce, specific, antibody, that, bind, to, the, virus, and, often, render, it, this, is, called, humoral, immunity, two, type, of, antibody, are, important, the, first, called, igm, is, highly, effective, at, neutralizing, virus, but, is, produced, by, the, cell, of, the, immune, system, only, for, a, few, week, the, second, called, igg, is, produced, indefinitely, the, presence, of, igm, in, the, blood, of, the, host, is, used, to, test, for, acute, infection, whereas, igg, indicates, an, infection, sometime, in, the, past, igg, antibody, is, measured, when, test, for, immunity, are, carried, out, antibody, can, continue, to, be, an, effective, defence, mechanism, even, after, virus, have, managed, to, gain, entry, to, the, host, cell, a, protein, that, is, in, cell, called, can, attach, to, the, antibody, on, the, surface, of, the, virus, particle, this, prime, the, subsequent, destruction, of, the, virus, by, the, enzyme, of, the, cell, proteosome, system, two, rotavirus, the, one, on, the, right, is, coated, with, antibody, that, stop, it, attaching, to, cell, and, infecting, them, a, second, defence, of, vertebrate, against, virus, is, called, immunity, and, involves, immune, cell, known, a, t, cell, the, body, cell, constantly, display, short, fragment, of, their, protein, on, the, cell, surface, and, if, a, t, cell, recognises, a, suspicious, viral, fragment, there, the, host, cell, is, destroyed, by, killer, t, cell, and, the, proliferate, cell, such, a, the, macrophage, are, specialist, at, this, antigen, presentation, the, production, of, interferon, is, an, important, host, defence, mechanism, this, is, a, hormone, produced, by, the, body, when, virus, are, present, it, role, in, immunity, is, complex, it, eventually, stop, the, virus, from, reproducing, by, killing, the, infected, cell, and, it, close, neighbour, not, all, virus, infection, produce, a, protective, immune, response, in, this, way, hiv, evades, the, immune, system, by, constantly, changing, the, amino, acid, sequence, of, the, protein, on, the, surface, of, the, virion, this, is, known, a, escape, mutation, a, the, viral, epitope, escape, recognition, by, the, host, immune, response, these, persistent, virus, evade, immune, control, by, sequestration, blockade, of, antigen, presentation, cytokine, resistance, evasion, of, natural, killer, cell, activity, escape, from, apoptosis, and, antigenic, shift, other, virus, called, neurotropic, virus, are, disseminated, by, neural, spread, where, the, immune, system, may, be, unable, to, reach, them, prevention, and, treatment, because, virus, use, vital, metabolic, pathway, within, host, cell, to, replicate, they, are, difficult, to, eliminate, without, using, drug, that, cause, toxic, effect, to, host, cell, in, general, the, most, effective, medical, approach, to, viral, disease, are, vaccination, to, provide, immunity, to, infection, and, antiviral, drug, that, selectively, interfere, with, viral, replication, vaccine, for, more, detail, on, this, topic, see, vaccination, vaccination, is, a, cheap, and, effective, way, of, preventing, infection, by, virus, vaccine, were, used, to, prevent, viral, infection, long, before, the, discovery, of, the, actual, virus, their, use, ha, resulted, in, a, dramatic, decline, in, morbidity, illness, and, mortality, death, associated, with, viral, infection, such, a, polio, measles, mumps, and, rubella, smallpox, infection, have, been, eradicated, vaccine, are, available, to, prevent, over, thirteen, viral, infection, of, human, and, more, are, used, to, prevent, viral, infection, of, animal, vaccine, can, consist, of, or, killed, virus, or, viral, protein, antigen, live, vaccine, contain, weakened, form, of, the, virus, which, do, not, cause, the, disease, but, nonetheless, confer, immunity, such, virus, are, called, attenuated, live, vaccine, can, be, dangerous, when, given, to, people, with, a, weak, immunity, who, are, described, a, immunocompromised, because, in, these, people, the, weakened, virus, can, cause, the, original, disease, biotechnology, and, genetic, engineering, technique, are, used, to, produce, subunit, vaccine, these, vaccine, use, only, the, capsid, protein, of, the, virus, hepatitis, b, vaccine, is, an, example, of, this, type, of, vaccine, subunit, vaccine, are, safe, for, immunocompromised, patient, because, they, can, not, cause, the, disease, the, yellow, fever, virus, vaccine, a, strain, called, is, probably, the, safest, and, most, effective, vaccine, ever, generated, antiviral, drug, guanosine, the, guanosine, analogue, aciclovir, for, more, detail, on, this, topic, see, antiviral, drug, antiviral, drug, are, often, nucleoside, analogue, fake, dna, which, virus, mistakenly, incorporate, into, their, genome, during, replication, the, of, the, virus, is, then, halted, because, the, newly, synthesised, dna, is, inactive, this, is, because, these, analogue, lack, the, hydroxyl, group, which, along, with, phosphorus, atom, link, together, to, form, the, strong, backbone, of, the, dna, molecule, this, is, called, dna, chain, termination, example, of, nucleoside, analogue, are, aciclovir, for, herpes, simplex, virus, infection, and, lamivudine, for, hiv, and, hepatitis, b, virus, infection, aciclovir, is, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, frequently, prescribed, antiviral, drug, other, antiviral, drug, in, use, target, different, stage, of, the, viral, life, cycle, hiv, is, dependent, on, a, proteolytic, enzyme, called, the, protease, for, it, to, become, fully, infectious, there, is, a, large, class, of, drug, called, protease, inhibitor, that, inactivate, this, enzyme, hepatitis, c, is, caused, by, an, rna, virus, in, of, people, infected, the, disease, is, chronic, and, without, treatment, they, are, infected, for, the, remainder, of, their, life, however, there, is, now, an, effective, treatment, that, us, the, nucleoside, analogue, drug, ribavirin, combined, with, interferon, the, treatment, of, chronic, carrier, of, the, hepatitis, b, virus, by, using, a, similar, strategy, using, lamivudine, ha, been, developed, infection, in, other, specie, virus, infect, all, cellular, life, and, although, virus, occur, universally, each, cellular, specie, ha, it, own, specific, range, that, often, infect, only, that, specie, some, virus, called, satellite, can, replicate, only, within, cell, that, have, already, been, infected, by, another, virus, animal, virus, main, article, animal, virus, and, veterinary, virology, virus, are, important, pathogen, of, livestock, disease, such, a, disease, and, bluetongue, are, caused, by, virus, companion, animal, such, a, cat, dog, and, horse, if, not, vaccinated, are, susceptible, to, serious, viral, infection, canine, parvovirus, is, caused, by, a, small, dna, virus, and, infection, are, often, fatal, in, pup, like, all, invertebrate, the, honey, bee, is, susceptible, to, many, viral, infection, however, most, virus, harmlessly, in, their, host, and, cause, no, sign, or, symptom, of, disease, plant, virus, pepper, infected, by, mild, mottle, virus, main, article, plant, virus, there, are, many, type, of, plant, virus, but, often, they, cause, only, a, loss, of, yield, and, it, is, not, economically, viable, to, try, to, control, them, plant, virus, are, often, spread, from, plant, to, plant, by, organism, known, a, vector, these, are, normally, insect, but, some, fungi, nematode, worm, and, organism, have, been, shown, to, be, vector, when, control, of, plant, virus, infection, is, considered, economical, for, perennial, fruit, for, example, effort, are, concentrated, on, killing, the, vector, and, removing, alternate, host, such, a, weed, plant, virus, can, not, infect, human, and, other, animal, because, they, can, reproduce, only, in, living, plant, cell, plant, have, elaborate, and, effective, defence, mechanism, against, virus, one, of, the, most, effective, is, the, presence, of, resistance, r, gene, each, r, gene, confers, resistance, to, a, particular, virus, by, triggering, localised, area, of, cell, death, around, the, infected, cell, which, can, often, be, seen, with, the, unaided, eye, a, large, spot, this, stop, the, infection, from, spreading, rna, interference, is, also, an, effective, defence, in, plant, when, they, are, infected, plant, often, produce, natural, disinfectant, that, kill, virus, such, a, salicylic, acid, nitric, oxide, and, reactive, oxygen, molecule, plant, virus, particle, or, particle, vlps, have, application, in, both, biotechnology, and, nanotechnology, the, capsid, of, most, plant, virus, are, simple, and, robust, structure, and, can, be, produced, in, large, quantity, either, by, the, infection, of, plant, or, by, expression, in, a, variety, of, heterologous, system, plant, virus, particle, can, be, modified, genetically, and, chemically, to, encapsulate, foreign, material, and, can, be, incorporated, into, supramolecular, structure, for, use, in, biotechnology, bacterial, virus, transmission, electron, micrograph, of, multiple, bacteriophage, attached, to, a, bacterial, cell, wall, main, article, bacteriophage, bacteriophage, are, a, common, and, diverse, group, of, virus, and, are, the, most, abundant, form, of, biological, entity, in, aquatic, environment, there, are, up, to, ten, time, more, of, these, virus, in, the, ocean, than, there, are, bacteria, reaching, level, of, bacteriophage, per, millilitre, of, seawater, these, virus, infect, specific, bacteria, by, binding, to, surface, receptor, molecule, and, then, entering, the, cell, within, a, short, amount, of, time, in, some, case, just, minute, bacterial, polymerase, start, translating, viral, mrna, into, protein, these, protein, go, on, to, become, either, new, virion, within, the, cell, helper, protein, which, help, assembly, of, new, virion, or, protein, involved, in, cell, lysis, viral, enzyme, aid, in, the, breakdown, of, the, cell, membrane, and, in, the, case, of, the, phage, in, just, over, twenty, minute, after, injection, over, three, hundred, phage, could, be, released, the, major, way, bacteria, defend, themselves, from, bacteriophage, is, by, producing, enzyme, that, destroy, foreign, dna, these, enzyme, called, restriction, endonuclease, cut, up, the, viral, dna, that, bacteriophage, inject, into, bacterial, cell, bacteria, also, contain, a, system, that, us, crispr, sequence, to, retain, fragment, of, the, genome, of, virus, that, the, bacteria, have, come, into, contact, with, in, the, past, which, allows, them, to, block, the, virus, replication, through, a, form, of, rna, interference, this, genetic, system, provides, bacteria, with, acquired, immunity, to, infection, archaean, virus, some, virus, replicate, within, archaea, these, are, dna, virus, with, unusual, and, sometimes, unique, shape, these, virus, have, been, studied, in, most, detail, in, the, thermophilic, archaea, particularly, the, order, sulfolobales, and, thermoproteales, defence, against, these, virus, may, involve, rna, interference, from, repetitive, dna, sequence, within, archaean, genome, that, are, related, to, the, gene, of, the, virus, role, in, aquatic, ecosystem, main, article, marine, bacteriophage, a, teaspoon, of, seawater, contains, about, one, million, virus, most, of, these, are, bacteriophage, which, are, harmless, to, plant, and, animal, and, are, in, fact, essential, to, the, regulation, of, saltwater, and, freshwater, ecosystem, they, infect, and, destroy, bacteria, in, aquatic, microbial, community, and, are, the, most, important, mechanism, of, recycling, carbon, in, the, marine, environment, the, organic, molecule, released, from, the, dead, bacterial, cell, stimulate, fresh, bacterial, and, algal, growth, viral, activity, may, also, contribute, to, the, biological, pump, the, process, whereby, carbon, is, sequestered, in, the, deep, ocean, microorganism, constitute, more, than, of, the, biomass, in, the, sea, it, is, estimated, that, virus, kill, approximately, of, this, biomass, each, day, and, that, there, are, time, a, many, virus, in, the, ocean, a, there, are, bacteria, and, archaea, virus, are, the, main, agent, responsible, for, the, rapid, destruction, of, harmful, algal, bloom, which, often, kill, other, marine, life, the, number, of, virus, in, the, ocean, decrease, further, offshore, and, deeper, into, the, water, where, there, are, fewer, host, organism, like, any, organism, marine, mammal, are, susceptible, to, viral, infection, in, and, thousand, of, harbor, seal, were, killed, in, europe, by, phocine, distemper, virus, many, other, virus,

to, interaction, between, the, carrier, host, and, domestic, animal, highly, mobile, animal, such, a, bat, and, bird, may, present, a, greater, risk, of, zoonotic, transmission, than, other, animal, due, to, the, ease, with, which, they, can, move, into, area, of, human, habitation, because, they, depend, on, the, human, host, for, part, of, their, disease, such, a, african, schistosomiasis,
