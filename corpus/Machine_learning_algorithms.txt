abbreviation, for, backward, propagation, of, error, is, a, common, method, of, training, artificial, neural, network, used, in, conjunction, with, an, optimization, method, such, a, gradient, descent, the, method, calculates, the, gradient, of, a, loss, function, with, respect, to, all, the, weight, in, the, network, the, gradient, is, fed, to, the, optimization, method, which, in, turn, us, it, to, update, the, weight, in, an, attempt, to, minimize, the, loss, function, backpropagation, requires, a, known, desired, output, for, each, input, value, in, order, to, calculate, the, loss, function, gradient, it, is, therefore, usually, considered, to, be, a, supervised, learning, method, although, it, is, also, used, in, some, unsupervised, network, such, a, autoencoders, it, is, a, generalization, of, the, delta, rule, to, feedforward, network, made, possible, by, using, the, chain, rule, to, iteratively, compute, gradient, for, each, layer, backpropagation, requires, that, the,

external, link, motivation, edit, the, goal, of, any, supervised, learning, algorithm, is, to, find, a, function, that, best, map, a, set, of, input, to, it, correct, output, an, example, would, be, a, simple, classification, task, where, the, input, is, an, image, of, an, animal, and, the, correct, output, would, be, the, name, of, the, animal, some, input, and, output, pattern, can, be, easily, learned, by, neural, network, perceptrons, however, these, perceptrons, can, not, learn, some, relatively, simple, pattern, such, a, those, that, are, not, linearly, separable, for, example, a, human, may, classify, an, image, of, an, animal, by, recognizing, certain, feature, such, a, the, number, of, limb, the, texture, of, the, skin, whether, it, is, furry, feathered, scaled, etc, the, size, of, the, animal, and, the, list, go, on, a, neural, network, however, must, learn, a, function, that, output, a, label, solely, using, the, intensity, of, the, pixel, in, the, image, there, is, no, way, for, it, to, learn, any, abstract, feature, of, the, input, since, it, is, limited, to, having, only, one, layer, a, network, overcomes, this, limitation, a, it, can, create, internal, representation, and, learn, different, feature, in, each, layer, the, first, layer, may, be, responsible, for, learning, the, orientation, of, line, using, the, input, from, the, individual, pixel, in, the, image, the, second, layer, may, combine, the, feature, learned, in, the, first, layer, and, learn, to, identify, simple, shape, such, a, circle, each, higher, layer, learns, more, and, more, abstract, feature, such, a, those, mentioned, above, that, can, be, used, to, classify, the, image, each, layer, find, pattern, in, the, layer, below, it, and, it, is, this, ability, to, create, internal, representation, that, are, independent, of, outside, input, that, give, network, their, power, the, goal, and, motivation, for, developing, the, backpropagation, algorithm, wa, to, find, a, way, to, train, a, neural, network, such, that, it, can, learn, the, appropriate, internal, representation, to, allow, it, to, learn, any, arbitrary, mapping, of, input, to, output, summary, edit, the, backpropagation, learning, algorithm, can, be, divided, into, two, phase, propagation, and, weight, update, phase, propagation, edit, each, propagation, involves, the, following, step, forward, propagation, of, a, training, pattern, input, through, the, neural, network, in, order, to, generate, the, propagation, output, activation, backward, propagation, of, the, propagation, output, activation, through, the, neural, network, using, the, training, pattern, target, in, order, to, generate, the, delta, the, difference, between, the, input, and, output, value, of, all, output, and, hidden, neuron, phase, weight, update, edit, for, each, follow, the, following, step, multiply, it, output, delta, and, input, activation, to, get, the, gradient, of, the, weight, subtract, a, ratio, percentage, of, the, gradient, from, the, weight, this, ratio, percentage, influence, the, speed, and, quality, of, learning, it, is, called, the, learning, rate, the, greater, the, ratio, the, faster, the, neuron, train, the, lower, the, ratio, the, more, accurate, the, training, is, the, sign, of, the, gradient, of, a, weight, indicates, where, the, error, is, increasing, this, is, why, the, weight, must, be, updated, in, the, opposite, direction, repeat, phase, and, until, the, performance, of, the, network, is, satisfactory, algorithm, edit, algorithm, for, a, network, only, one,

name, implies, the, error, propagate, backwards, from, the, output, node, to, the, input, node, technically, speaking, backpropagation, calculates, the, gradient, of, the, error, of, the, network, regarding, the, network, modifiable, weight, this, gradient, is, almost, always, used, in, a, simple, stochastic, gradient, descent, algorithm, to, find, weight, that, minimize, the, error, often, the, term, backpropagation, is, used, in, a, more, general, sense, to, refer, to, the, entire, procedure, encompassing, both, the, calculation, of, the, gradient, and, it, use, in, stochastic, gradient, descent, backpropagation, usually, allows, quick, convergence, on, satisfactory, local, minimum, for, error, in, the, kind, of, network, to, which, it, is, suited, backpropagation, network, are, necessarily, multilayer, perceptrons, usually, with, one, input, one, hidden, and, one, output, layer, in, order, for, the, hidden, layer, to, serve, any, useful, function, multilayer, network, must, have, activation, function, for, the, multiple, layer, a, multilayer, network, using, only, linear, activation, function, is, equivalent, to, some, single, layer, linear, network, activation, function, that, are, commonly, used, include, the, logistic, function, the, softmax, function, and, the, gaussian, function, the, backpropagation, algorithm, for, calculating, a, gradient, ha, been, rediscovered, a, number, of, time, and, is, a, special, case, of, a, more, general, technique, called, automatic, differentiation, in, the, reverse, accumulation, mode, it, is, also, closely, related, to, the, algorithm, and, is, also, part, of, continuing, research, in, neural, backpropagation, intuition, edit, learning, a, an, optimization, problem, edit, before, showing, the, mathematical, derivation, of, the, backpropagation, algorithm, it, help, to, develop, some, intuition, about, the, relationship, between, the, actual, output, of, a, neuron, and, the, correct, output, for, a, particular, training, case, consider, a, simple, neural, network, with, two, input, unit, one, output, unit, and, no, hidden, unit, each, neuron, us, a, linear, output, note, that, is, the, weighted, sum, of, it, input, a, simple, neural, network, with, two, input, unit, and, one, output, unit, initially, before, training, the, weight, will, be, set, randomly, then, the, neuron, learns, from, training, example, which, in, this, case, consists, of, a, set, of, tuples, where, and, are, the, input, to, the, network, and, is, the, correct, output, the, output, the, network, should, eventually, produce, given, the, identical, input, the, network, given, and, will, compute, an, output, which, very, likely, differs, from, since, the, weight, are, initially, random, a, common, method, for, measuring, the, discrepancy, between, the, expected, output, and, the, actual, output, is, using, the, squared, error, measure, where, is, the, discrepancy, or, error, a, an, example, consider, the, network, on, a, single, training, case, thus, the, input, and, are, and, respectively, and, the, correct, output, is, now, if, the, actual, output, is, plotted, on, the, against, the, error, on, the, the, result, is, a, parabola, the, minimum, of, the, parabola, corresponds, to, the, output, which, minimizes, the, error, for, a, single, training, case, the, minimum, also, touch, the, which, mean, the, error, will, be, zero, and, the, network, can, produce, an, output, that, exactly, match, the, expected, output, therefore, the, problem, of, mapping, input, to, output, can, be, reduced, to, an, optimization, problem, of, finding, a, function, that, will, produce, the, minimal, error, error, surface, of, a, linear, neuron, for, a, single, training, case, however, the, output, of, a, neuron, depends, on, the, weighted, sum, of, all, it, input, where, and, are, the, weight, on, the, connection, from, the, input, unit, to, the, output, unit, therefore, the, error, also, depends, on, the, incoming, weight, to, the, neuron, which, is, ultimately, what, need, to, be, changed, in, the, network, to, enable, learning, if, each, weight, is, plotted, on, a, separate, horizontal, axis, and, the, error, on, the, vertical, axis, the, result, is, a, parabolic, bowl, if, a, neuron, ha, weight, then, the, dimension, of, the, error, surface, would, be, thus, a, dimensional, equivalent, of, the, parabola, error, surface, of, a, linear, neuron, with, two, input, weight, the, backpropagation, algorithm, aim, to, find, the, set, of, weight, that, minimizes, the, error, there, are, several, method, for, finding, the, minimum, of, a, parabola, or, any, function, in, any, dimension, one, way, is, analytically, by, solving, system, of, equation, however, this, relies, on, the, network, being, a, linear, system, and, the, goal, is, to, be, able, to, also, train, network, since, a, linear, network, is, equivalent, to, a, network, the, method, used, in, backpropagation, is, gradient, descent, an, analogy, for, understanding, gradient, descent, edit, further, information, gradient, descent, the, basic, intuition, behind, gradient, descent, can, be, illustrated, by, a, hypothetical, scenario, a, person, is, stuck, in, the, mountain, is, trying, to, get, down, trying, to, find, the, minimum, there, is, heavy, fog, such, that, visibility, is, extremely, low, therefore, the, path, down, the, mountain, is, not, visible, so, he, must, use, local, information, to, find, the, minimum, he, can, use, the, method, of, gradient, descent, which, involves, looking, at, the, steepness, of, the, hill, at, his, current, position, then, proceeding, in, the, direction, with, the, most, negative, steepness, downhill, if, he, wa, trying, to, find, the, top, of, the, mountain, the, maximum, then, he, would, proceed, in, the, direction, with, most, positive, steepness, uphill, using, this, method, he, would, eventually, find, his, way, down, the, mountain, however, assume, also, that, the, steepness, of, the, hill, is, not, immediately, obvious, with, simple, observation, but, rather, it, requires, a, sophisticated, instrument, to, measure, which, the, person, happens, to, have, at, the, moment, it, take, quite, some, time, to, measure, the, steepness, of, the, hill, with, the, instrument, thus, he, should, minimize, his, use, of, the, instrument, if, he, wanted, to, get, down, the, mountain, before, sunset, the, difficulty, then, is, choosing, the, frequency, at, which, he, should, measure, the, steepness, of, the, hill, so, not, to, go, off, track, in, this, analogy, the, person, represents, the, backpropagation, algorithm, and, the, path, down, the, mountain, represents, the, set, of, weight, that, will, minimize, the, error, the, steepness, of, the, hill, represents, the, slope, of, the, error, surface, at, that, point, the, direction, he, must, travel, in, corresponds, to, the, gradient, of, the, error, surface, at, that, point, the, instrument, used, to, measure, steepness, is, differentiation, the, slope, of, the, error, surface, can, be, calculated, by, taking, the, derivative, of, the, squared, error, function, at, that, point, the, distance, he, travel, in, between, measurement, which, is, also, proportional, to, the, frequency, a, which, he, take, measurement, is, the, learning, rate, of, the, algorithm, see, the, limitation, section, for, a, discussion, of, the, limitation, of, this, type, of, hill, climbing, algorithm, derivation, edit, since, backpropagation, us, the, gradient, descent, method, one, need, to, calculate, the, derivative, of, the, squared, error, function, with, respect, to, the, weight, of, the, network, assuming, one, output, neuron, note, the, squared, error, function, is, where, is, the, squared, error, is, the, target, output, for, a, training, sample, and, is, the, actual, output, of, the, output, neuron, the, factor, of, is, included, to, cancel, the, exponent, when, differentiating, later, the, expression, will, be, multiplied, with, an, arbitrary, learning, rate, so, that, it, doe, matter, if, a, constant, coefficient, is, introduced, now, for, each, neuron, it, output, is, defined, a, the, input, to, a, neuron, is, the, weighted, sum, of, output, of, previous, neuron, if, the, neuron, is, in, the, first, layer, after, the, input, layer, the, of, the, input, layer, are, simply, the, input, to, the, network, the, number, of, input, unit, to, the, neuron, is, the, variable, denotes, the, weight, between, neuron, and, the, activation, function, is, in, general, and, differentiable, a, commonly, used, activation, function, is, the, logistic, function, which, ha, a, nice, derivative, of, finding, the, derivative, of, the, error, edit, calculating, the, partial, derivative, of, the, error, with, respect, to, a, weight, is, done, using, the, chain, rule, twice, in, the, last, term, of, the, side, only, one, term, in, the, sum, depends, on, so, that, the, derivative, of, the, output, of, neuron, with, respect, to, it, input, is, simply, the, partial, derivative, of, the, activation, function, assuming, here, that, the, logistic, function, is, used, this, is, the, reason, why, backpropagation, requires, the, activation, function, to, be, differentiable, the, first, term, is, straightforward, to, evaluate, if, the, neuron, is, in, the, output, layer, because, then, and, however, if, is, in, an, arbitrary, inner, layer, of, the, network, finding, the, derivative, with, respect, to, is, le, obvious, considering, a, a, function, of, the, input, of, all, neuron, receiving, input, from, neuron, and, taking, the, total, derivative, with, respect, to, a, recursive, expression, for, the, derivative, is, obtained, therefore, the, derivative, with, respect, to, can, be, calculated, if, all, the, derivative, with, respect, to, the, output, of, the, next, layer, the, one, closer, to, the, output, neuron, are, known, putting, it, all, together, with, to, update, the, weight, using, gradient, descent, one, must, choose, a, learning, rate, the, change, in, weight, which, is, added, to, the, old, weight, is, equal, to, the, product, of, the, learning, rate, and, the, gradient, multiplied, by, the, is, required, in, order, to, update, in, the, direction, of, a, minimum, not, a, maximum, of, the, error, function, for, a, network, this, expression, becomes, the, delta, rule, to, better, understand, how, backpropagation, work, here, is, an, example, to, illustrate, it, the, back, propagation, algorithm, page, mode, of, learning, edit, there, are, three, mode, of, learning, to, choose, from, batch, and, stochastic, in, and, stochastic, learning, each, propagation, is, followed, immediately, by, a, weight, update, in, batch, learning, many, propagation, occur, before, updating, the, weight, learning, is, used, for, dynamic, environment, that, provide, a, continuous, stream, of, new, pattern, stochastic, learning, and, batch, learning, both, make, use, of, a, training, set, of, static, pattern, stochastic, go, through, the, data, set, in, a, random, order, in, order, to, reduce, it, chance, of, getting, stuck, in, local, minimum, stochastic, learning, is, also, much, faster, than, batch, learning, since, weight, are, updated, immediately, after, each, propagation, yet, batch, learning, will, yield, a, much, more, stable, descent, to, a, local, minimum, since, each, update, is, performed, based, on, all, pattern, limitation, edit, this, section, doe, not, cite, any, reference, or, source, please, help, improve, this,

of, gradient, descent, is, guaranteed, to, work, if, there, is, only, one, minimum, however, often, the, error, surface, ha, many, local, minimum, and, maximum, if, the, starting, point, of, the, gradient, descent, happens, to, be, somewhere, between, a, local, maximum, and, local, minimum, then, going, down, the, direction, with, the, most, negative, gradient, will, lead, to, the, local,

random, walk, markov, chain, the, basic, observation, is, that, if, we, take, a, random, walk, on, the, data, walking, to, a, nearby, is, more, likely, than, walking, to, another, that, is, far, away, let, be, a, measure, space, where, is, the, data, set, and, represents, the, distribution, on, the, point, on, based, on, this, the, connectivity, between, two, data, point, and, can, be, defined, a, the, probability, of, walking, from, to, in, one, step, of, the, random, walk, usually, this, probability, is, specified, in, term, of, kernel, function, on, the, two, point, for, example, the, popular, gaussian, kernel, more, generally, the, kernel, function, ha, the, following, property, is, symmetric, is, positivity, preserving, the, kernel, constitutes, the, prior, definition, of, the, local, geometry, of, since, a, given, kernel, will, capture, a, specific, feature, of, the, data, set, it, choice, should, be, guided, by, the, application, that, one, ha, in, mind, this, is, a, major, difference, with, method, such, a, principal, component, analysis, where, correlation, between, all, data, point, are, taken, into, account, at, once, given, we, can, then, construct, a, reversible, markov, chain, on, a, process, known, a, the, normalized, graph, laplacian, construction, and, define, although, the, new, normalized, kernel, doe, not, inherit, the, symmetric, property, it, doe, inherit, the, property, and, gain, a, conservation, property, diffusion, process, edit, from, we, can, construct, a, transition, matrix, of, a, markov, chain, on, in, other, word, represents, the, transition, probability, from, to, and, give, the, transition, matrix, we, define, the, diffusion, matrix, it, is, also, a, version, of, graph, laplacian, matrix, we, then, define, the, new, kernel, or, equivalently, where, d, is, a, diagonal, matrix, and, we, apply, the, graph, laplacian, normalization, to, this, new, kernel, where, is, a, diagonal, matrix, and, one, of, the, main, idea, of, diffusion, framework, is, that, running, the, chain, forward, in, time, taking, larger, and, larger, power, of, reveals, the, geometric, structure, of, at, larger, and, larger, scale, the, diffusion, process, specifically, the, notion, of, a, cluster, in, the, data, set, is, quantified, a, a, region, in, which, the, probability, of, escaping, this, region, is, low, within, a, certain, time, t, therefore, t, not, only, serf, a, a, time, parameter, but, also, ha, the, dual, role, of, scale, parameter, the, eigendecomposition, of, the, matrix, yield, where, is, the, sequence, of, eigenvalue, of, and, and, are, the, biorthogonal, right, and, left, eigenvectors, respectively, due, to, the, spectrum, decay, of, the, eigenvalue, only, a, few, term, are, necessary, to, achieve, a, given, relative, accuracy, in, this, sum, parameter, and, the, diffusion, operator, edit, the, reason, to, introduce, the, normalization, step, involving, is, to, tune, the, influence, of, the, data, point, density, on, the, infinitesimal, transition, of, the, diffusion, in, some, application, the, sampling, of, the, data, is, generally, not, related, to, the, geometry, of, the, manifold, we, are, interested, in, describing, in, this, case, we, can, set, and, the, diffusion, operator, approximates, the, operator, we, then, recover, the, riemannian, geometry, of, the, data, set, regardless, of, the, distribution, of, the, point, to, describe, the, behavior, of, the, point, distribution, of, a, system, of, stochastic, differential, equation, we, can, use, and, the, resulting, markov, chain, approximates, the, diffusion, with, it, reduces, to, the, classical, graph, laplacian, normalization, diffusion, distance, edit, the, diffusion, distance, at, time, between, two, point, can, be, measured, a, the, similarity, of, two, point, in, the, observation, space, with, the, connectivity, between, them, it, is, given, by, where, is, the, stationary, distribution, of, the, markov, chain, given, by, the, first, left, eigenvector, of, explicitly, intuitively, is, small, if, there, is, a, large, number, of, short, path, connecting, and, there, are, several, interesting, feature, associated, with, the, diffusion, distance, based, on, our, previous, discussion, that, also, serf, a, a, scale, parameter, point, are, closer, at, a, given, scale, a, specified, by, if, they, are, highly, connected, in, the, graph, therefore, emphasizing, the, concept, of, a, cluster, this, distance, is, robust, to, noise, since, the, distance, between, two, point, depends, on, all, possible, path, of, length, between, the, point, from, a, machine, learning, point, of, view, the, distance, take, into, account, all, evidence, linking, to, allowing, u, to, conclude, that, this, distance, is, appropriate, for, the, design, of, inference, algorithm, based, on, the, majority, of, preponderance, diffusion, process, and, embedding, edit, the, diffusion, distance, can, be, calculated, using, the, eigenvectors, by, so, the, eigenvectors, can, be, used, a, a, new, set, of, coordinate, for, the, data, the, diffusion, map, is, defined, a, because, of, the, spectrum, decay, it, is, sufficient, to, use, only, the, first, k, eigenvectors, and, eigenvalue, thus, we, get, the, diffusion, map, from, the, original, data, to, a, space, which, is, embedded, in, the, original, space, in, it, is, proved, that, so, the, euclidean, distance, in, the, diffusion, coordinate, approximates, the, diffusion, distance, algorithm, edit, the, basic, algorithm, framework, of, diffusion, map, is, a, step, given, the, similarity, matrix, l, step, normalize, the, matrix, according, to, parameter, step, form, the, normalized, matrix, step, compute, the, k, largest, eigenvalue, of, and, the, corresponding, eigenvectors, step, use, diffusion, map, to, get, the, embedding, application, edit, in, the, paper, they, showed, how, to, design, a, kernel, that, reproduces, the, diffusion, induced, by, a, equation, also, they, explained, that, when, the, data, approximate, a, manifold, then, one, can, recover, the, geometry, of, this, manifold, by, computing, an, approximation, of, the, operator, this, computation, is, completely, insensitive, to, the, distribution, of, the, point, and, therefore, provides, a, separation, of, the, statistic, and, the, geometry, of, the, data, since, diffusion, map, give, a, global, description, of, the, it, can, measure, the, distance, between, pair, of, sample, point, in, the, manifold, the, data, is, embedded, based, on, diffusion, map, there, are, many,

analysis, mcda, introduced, by, greco, matarazzo, and, the, main, change, comparing, to, the, classical, rough, set, is, the, substitution, of, the, indiscernibility, relation, by, a, dominance, relation, which, permit, to, deal, with, inconsistency, typical, to, consideration, of, criterion, and, decision, class, content, multicriteria, classification, sorting, data, representation, decision, table, outranking, relation, decision, class, and, class, union, main, concept, dominance, rough, approximation, quality, of, approximation, and, reducts, decision, rule, example, extension, multicriteria, choice, and, ranking, problem, drsa, stochastic, drsa, software, see, also, reference, external, link, multicriteria, classification, sorting, edit, multicriteria, classification, sorting, is, one, of, the, problem, considered, within, mcda, and, can, be, stated, a, follows, given, a, set, of, object, evaluated, by, a, set, of, criterion, attribute, with, domain, assign, these, object, to, some, and, decision, class, such, that, each, object, is, assigned, to, exactly, one, class, due, to, the, preference, ordering, improvement, of, evaluation, of, an, object, on, the, criterion, should, not, worsen, it, class, assignment, the, sorting, problem, is, very, similar, to, the, problem, of, classification, however, in, the, latter, the, object, are, evaluated, by, regular, attribute, and, the, decision, class, are, not, necessarily, preference, ordered, the, problem, of, multicriteria, classification, is, also, referred, to, a, ordinal, classification, problem, with, monotonicity, constraint, and, often, appears, in, application, when, ordinal, and, monotone, property, follow, from, the, domain, knowledge, about, the, problem, a, an, illustrative, example, consider, the, problem, of, evaluation, in, a, high, school, the, director, of, the, school, want, to, assign, student, object, to, three, class, bad, medium, and, good, notice, that, class, good, is, preferred, to, medium, and, medium, is, preferred, to, bad, each, student, is, described, by, three, criterion, level, in, physic, mathematics, and, literature, each, taking, one, of, three, possible, value, bad, medium, and, good, criterion, are, and, improving, the, level, from, one, of, the, subject, should, not, result, in, worse, global, evaluation, class, a, a, more, serious, example, consider, classification, of, bank, client, from, the, viewpoint, of, bankruptcy, risk, into, class, safe, and, risky, this, may, involve, such, characteristic, a, return, on, equity, roe, return, on, investment, roi, and, return, on, sale, ro, the, domain, of, these, attribute, are, not, simply, ordered, but, involve, a, preference, order, since, from, the, viewpoint, of, bank, manager, greater, value, of, roe, roi, or, ro, are, better, for, client, being, analysed, for, bankruptcy, risk, thus, these, attribute, are, criterion, neglecting, this, information, in, knowledge, discovery, may, lead, to, wrong, conclusion, data, representation, edit, decision, table, edit, in, drsa, data, are, often, presented, using, a, particular, form, of, decision, table, formally, a, drsa, decision, table, is, a, where, is, a, finite, set, of, object, is, a, finite, set, of, criterion, where, is, the, domain, of, the, criterion, and, is, an, information, function, such, that, for, every, the, set, is, divided, into, condition, criterion, set, and, the, decision, criterion, class, notice, that, is, an, evaluation, of, object, on, criterion, while, is, the, class, assignment, decision, value, of, the, object, an, example, of, decision, table, is, shown, in, table, below, outranking, relation, edit, it, is, assumed, that, the, domain, of, a, criterion, is, completely, preordered, by, an, outranking, relation, mean, that, is, at, least, a, good, a, outranks, with, respect, to, the, criterion, without, loss, of, generality, we, assume, that, the, domain, of, is, a, subset, of, real, and, that, the, outranking, relation, is, a, simple, order, between, real, number, such, that, the, following, relation, hold, this, relation, is, straightforward, for, the, more, the, better, criterion, company, profit, for, the, le, the, better, criterion, product, price, this, relation, can, be, satisfied, by, negating, the, value, from, decision, class, and, class, union, edit, let, the, domain, of, decision, criterion, consist, of, element, without, loss, of, generality, we, assume, and, induces, a, partition, of, into, class, where, each, object, is, assigned, to, one, and, only, one, class, the, class, are, according, to, an, increasing, order, of, class, index, for, all, such, that, the, object, from, are, strictly, preferred, to, the, object, from, for, this, reason, we, can, consider, the, upward, and, downward, union, of, class, defined, respectively, a, main, concept, edit, dominance, edit, we, say, that, dominates, with, respect, to, denoted, by, if, is, better, than, on, every, criterion, from, for, each, the, dominance, relation, is, reflexive, and, transitive, it, is, a, partial, given, and, let, represent, set, and, set, with, respect, to, respectively, rough, approximation, edit, the, key, idea, of, the, rough, set, philosophy, is, approximation, of, one, knowledge, by, another, knowledge, in, drsa, the, knowledge, being, approximated, is, a, collection, of, upward, and, downward, union, of, decision, class, and, the, granule, of, knowledge, used, for, approximation, are, and, set, the, and, the, approximation, of, with, respect, to, denoted, a, and, respectively, are, defined, a, analogously, the, and, the, approximation, of, with, respect, to, denoted, a, and, respectively, are, defined, a, lower, approximation, group, the, object, which, certainly, belong, to, class, union, respectively, this, certainty, come, from, the, fact, that, object, belongs, to, the, lower, approximation, respectively, if, no, other, object, in, contradicts, this, claim, every, object, which, also, belong, to, the, class, union, respectively, upper, approximation, group, the, object, which, could, belong, to, respectively, since, object, belongs, to, the, upper, approximation, respectively, if, there, exist, another, object, by, from, class, union, respectively, the, and, approximation, defined, a, above, satisfy, the, following, property, for, all, and, for, any, the, region, of, and, are, defined, a, quality, of, approximation, and, reducts, edit, the, ratio, defines, the, quality, of, approximation, of, the, partition, into, class, by, mean, of, the, set, of, criterion, this, ratio, express, the, relation, between, all, the, classified, object, and, all, the, object, in, the, table, every, minimal, subset, such, that, is, called, a, reduct, of, and, is, denoted, by, a, decision, table, may, have, more, than, one, reduct, the, intersection, of, all, reducts, is, known, a, the, core, decision, rule, edit, on, the, basis, of, the, approximation, obtained, by, mean, of, the, dominance, relation, it, is, possible, to, induce, a, generalized, description, of, the, preferential, information, contained, in, the, decision, table, in, term, of, decision, rule, the, decision, rule, are, expression, of, the, form, if, condition, then, consequent, that, represent, a, form, of, dependency, between, condition, criterion, and, decision, criterion, procedure, for, generating, decision, rule, from, a, decision, table, use, an, inducive, learning, principle, we, can, distinguish, three, type, of, rule, certain, possible, and, approximate, certain, rule, are, generated, from, lower, approximation, of, union, of, class, possible, rule, are, generated, from, upper, approximation, of, union, of, class, and, approximate, rule, are, generated, from, boundary, region, certain, rule, ha, the, following, form, if, and, and, then, if, and, and, then, possible, rule, ha, a, similar, syntax, however, the, consequent, part, of, the, rule, ha, the, form, could, belong, to, or, the, form, could, belong, to, finally, approximate, rule, ha, the, syntax, if, and, and, and, and, and, then, the, certain, possible, and, approximate, rule, represent, certain, possible, and, ambiguous, knowledge, extracted, from, the, decision, table, each, decision, rule, should, be, minimal, since, a, decision, rule, is, an, implication, by, a, minimal, decision, rule, we, understand, such, an, implication, that, there, is, no, other, implication, with, an, antecedent, of, at, least, the, same, weakness, in, other, word, rule, using, a, subset, of, elementary, condition, weaker, elementary, condition, and, a, consequent, of, at, least, the, same, strength, in, other, word, rule, assigning, object, to, the, same, union, or, of, class, a, set, of, decision, rule, is, complete, if, it, is, able, to, cover, all, object, from, the, decision, table, in, such, a, way, that, consistent, object, are, to, their, original, class, and, inconsistent, object, are, classified, to, cluster, of, class, referring, to, this, inconsistency, we, call, minimal, each, set, of, decision, rule, that, is, complete, and, exclusion, of, any, rule, from, this, set, make, it, one, of, three, induction, strategy, can, be, adopted, to, obtain, a, set, of, decision, rule, generation, of, a, minimal, description, a, minimal, set, of, rule, generation, of, an, exhaustive, description, all, rule, for, a, given, data, matrix, generation, of, a, characteristic, description, a, set, of, rule, covering, relatively, many, object, each, however, all, together, not, necessarily, all, object, from, the, decision, table, the, most, popular, rule, induction, algorithm, for, rough, set, approach, is, domlem, which, generates, minimal, set, of, rule, example, edit, consider, the, following, problem, of, high, school, student, evaluation, table, school, evaluation, object, student, mathematics, physic, literature, global, score, medium, medium, bad, bad, good, medium, bad, medium, medium, good, bad, medium, bad, medium, good, bad, bad, bad, medium, bad, bad, medium, medium, medium, good, good, bad, good, good, medium, medium, medium, medium, medium, good, good, good, medium, good, good, each, object, student, is, described, by, three, criterion, related, to, the, level, in, mathematics, physic, and, literature, respectively, according, to, the, decision, attribute, the, student, are, divided, into, three, class, and, thus, the, following, union, of, class, were, approximated, the, class, of, at, most, bad, student, the, class, of, at, most, medium, student, the, class, of, at, least, medium, student, the, class, of, at, least, good, student, notice, that, evaluation, of, object, and, are, inconsistent, because, ha, better, evaluation, on, all, three, criterion, than, but, worse, global, score, therefore, lower, approximation, of, class, union, consist, of, the, following, object, thus, only, class, and, can, not, be, approximated, precisely, their, upper, approximation, are, a, follows, while, their, boundary, region, are, of, course, since, and, are, approximated, precisely, we, have, and, the, following, minimal, set, of, rule, can, be, induced, from, the, decision, table, if, then, if, and, and, then, if, then, if, and, then, if, and, then, if, and, then, if, and, then, if, then, if, then, if, and, then, the, last, rule, is, approximate, while, the, rest, are, certain, extension, edit, multicriteria, choice, and, ranking, problem, edit, the, other, two, problem, considered, within, decision, analysis, multicriteria, choice, and, ranking, problem, can, also, be, solved, using, rough, set, approach, this, is, done, by, converting, the, decision, table, into, pairwise, comparison, table, pct, drsa, edit, the, definition, of, rough, approximation, are, based, on, a, strict, application, of, the, dominance, principle, however, when, defining, object, it, is, reasonable, to, accept, a, limited, proportion, of, negative, example, particularly, for, large, decision, table, such, extended, version, of, drsa, is, called, drsa, model, stochastic, drsa, edit, in, data, particularly, for, large, datasets, the, notion, of, rough, approximation, were, found, to, be, excessively, restrictive, therefore, an, extension, of, drsa, based, on, stochastic, model, stochastic, drsa, which, allows, inconsistency, to, some, degree, ha, been, introduced, having, stated, the, probabilistic, model, for, ordinal, classification, problem, with, monotonicity, constraint, the, concept, of, lower, approximation, are, extended, to, the, stochastic, case, the, method, is, based, on, estimating, the, conditional, probability, using, the, nonparametric, maximum, likelihood, method, which, lead, to, the, problem, of, isotonic, regression, stochastic, rough, set, can, also, be, regarded, a, a, sort, of, model, software, edit, is, a, decision, support, system,

particularly, popular, citation, needed, approach, is, the, use, of, evolutionary, algorithm, to, optimize, feature, scaling, another, popular, approach, is, to, scale, feature, by, the, mutual, information, of, the, training, data, with, the, training, class, citation, needed, in, binary, two, class, classification, problem, it, is, helpful, to, choose, k, to, be, an, odd, number, a, this, avoids, tied, vote, one, popular, way, of, choosing, the, empirically, optimal, k, in, this, setting, is, via, bootstrap, method, property, edit, is, a, special, case, of, a, kernel, density, balloon,

are, needed, from, bayesian, literature, edit, linear, model, of, coregionalization, lmc, edit, in, lmc, output, are, expressed, a, linear, combination, of, independent, random, function, such, that, the, resulting, covariance, function, over, all, input, and, output, is, a, valid, positive, semidefinite, function, assuming, output, with, each, is, expressed, a, where, are, scalar, coefficient,

version, of, the, lmc, with, icm, assumes, that, the, element, of, the, coregionalization, matrix, can, be, written, a, for, some, suitable, coefficient, with, this, form, for, where, in, this, case, the, coefficient, and, the, kernel, matrix, for, multiple, output, becomes, icm, is, much, more, restrictive, than, the, lmc, since, it, assumes, that, each, basic, covariance, contributes, equally, to, the, construction, of, the, autocovariances, and, cross, covariance, for, the, output, however, the, computation, required, for, the, inference, are, greatly, simplified, semiparametric, latent, factor, model, slfm, edit, another, simplified, version, of, the, lmc, is, the, semiparametric, latent, factor, model, slfm, which, corresponds, to, setting, instead, of, a, in, icm, thus, each, latent, function, ha, it, own, covariance, edit, while, simple, the, structure, of, separable, kernel, can, be, too, limiting, for, some, problem, notable, example, of, kernel, in, the, regularization, literature, include, exponentiated, quadratic, eq, kernel, designed, to, estimate, or, vector, field, or, a, convex, combination, of, the, two, kernel, defined, by, transformation, in, the, bayesian, perspective, lmc, produce, a, separable, kernel, because, the, output, function, evaluated, at, a, point, only, depend, on, the, value, of, the, latent, function, at, a, way, to, mix, the, latent, function, is, by, convolving, a, base, process, with, a, smoothing, kernel, if, the, base, process, is, a, gaussian, process, the, convolved, process, is, gaussian, a, well, we, can, therefore, exploit, convolution, to, construct, covariance, function, this, method, of, producing, kernel, is, known, a, process, convolution, process, convolution, were, introduced, for, multiple, output, in, the, machine, learning, community, a, dependent, gaussian, process, implementation, edit, when, implementing, an, algorithm, using, any, of, the, kernel, above, practical, consideration, of, tuning, the, parameter, and, ensuring, reasonable, computation, time, must, be, considered, regularization, perspective, edit, approached, from, the, regularization, perspective, parameter, tuning, is, similar, to, the, case, and, can, generally, be, accomplished, with, cross, validation, solving, the, required, linear, system, is, typically, expensive, in, memory, and, time, if, the, kernel, is, separable, a, coordinate, transform, can, convert, to, a, matrix, greatly, reducing, the, computational, burden, by, solving, d, independent, subproblems, plus, the, eigendecomposition, of, in, particular, for, a, least, square, loss, function, tikhonov, regularization, there, exists, a, closed, form, solution, for, bayesian, perspective, edit, there, are, many, work, related, to,

utility, of, kernel, pca, particularly, for, clustering, observe, that, while, n, point, can, not, in, general, be, linearly, separated, in, dimension, they, can, almost, always, be, linearly, separated, in, dimension, that, is, given, n, point, if, we, map, them, to, an, space, with, where, it, is, easy, to, construct, a, hyperplane, that, divide, the, point, into, arbitrary, cluster, of, course, this, creates, linearly, independent, vector, so, there, is, no, covariance, on, which, to, perform, eigendecomposition, explicitly, a, we, would, in, linear, pca, instead, in, kernel, pca, a, arbitrary, function, is, that, is, never, calculated, explicitly, allowing, the, possibility, to, use, if, we, never, have, to, actually, evaluate, the, data, in, that, space, since, we, generally, try, to, avoid, working, in, the, which, we, will, call, the, space, we, can, create, the, kernel, which, represents, the, inner, product, space, see, gramian, matrix, of, the, otherwise, intractable, feature, space, the, dual, form, that, arises, in, the, creation, of, a, kernel, allows, u, to, mathematically, formulate, a, version, of, pca, in, which, we, never, actually, solve, the, eigenvectors, and, eigenvalue, of, the, covariance, matrix, in, the, see, kernel, trick, the, in, each, column, of, k, represent, the, dot, product, of, one, point, of, the, transformed, data, with, respect, to, all, the, transformed, point, n, point, some, kernel, are, shown, in, the, example, below, because, we, are, never, working, directly, in, the, feature, space, the, of, pca, is, restricted, in, that, it, computes, not, the, principal, component, themselves, but, the, projection, of, our, data, onto, those, component, to, evaluate, the, projection, from, a, point, in, the, feature, space, onto, the, kth, principal, component, where, superscript, k, mean, the, component, k, not, power, of, k, we, note, that, denotes, dot, product, which, is, simply, the, element, of, the, kernel, it, seems, all, that, left, is, to, calculate, and, normalize, the, which, can, be, done, by, solving, the, eigenvector, equation, where, n, is, the, number, of, data, point, in, the, set, and, and, are, the, eigenvalue, and, eigenvectors, of, then, to, normalize, the, eigenvectors, we, require, that, care, must, be, taken, regarding, the, fact, that, whether, or, not, ha, in, it, original, space, it, is, not, guaranteed, to, be, centered, in, the, feature, space, which, we, never, compute, explicitly, since, centered, data, is, required, to, perform, an, effective, principal,

pca, should, be, illustrated, here, in, linear, pca, we, can, use, the, eigenvalue, to, rank, the, eigenvectors, based, on, how, much, of, the, variation, of, the, data, is, captured, by, each, principal, component, this, is, useful, for, data, dimensionality, reduction, and, it, could, also, be, applied, to, kpca, however, in, practice, there, are, case, that, all, variation, of, the, data, are, same, this, is, typically, caused, by, a, wrong, choice, of, kernel, scale, large, datasets, edit, in, practice, a, large, data, set, lead, to, a, large, k, and, storing, k, may, become, a, problem, one, way, to, deal, with, this, is, to, perform, clustering, on, the, dataset, and, populate, the, kernel, with, the, mean, of, those, cluster, since, even, this, method, may, yield, a, relatively, large, k, it, is, common, to, compute, only, the, top, p, eigenvalue, and, eigenvectors, of, example, edit, input, point, before, kernel, pca, consider, three, concentric, cloud, of, point, shown, we, wish, to, use, kernel, pca, to, identify, these, group, the, color, of, the, point, is, not, part, of, the, algorithm, but, only, there, to, show, how, the, data, group, together, before, and, after, the, transformation, first, consider, the, kernel, applying, this, to, kernel, pca, yield, the, next, image, output, after, kernel, pca, with, the, three, group, are, distinguishable, using, the, first, component, only, now, consider, a, gaussian, kernel, that, is, this, kernel, is, a, measure, of, closeness, equal, to, when, the, point, coincide, and, equal, to, at, infinity, output, after, kernel, pca, with, a, gaussian, kernel, note, in, particular, that, the, first, principal, component, is, enough, to, distinguish, the, three, different, group, which, is, impossible, using, only, linear, pca, because, linear, pca, operates, only, in, the, given, in, this, case, space, in, which, these, concentric, point, cloud, are, not, linearly, separable,

deviation, of, a, given, data, point, with, respect, to, it, neighbour, lof, share, some, concept, with, dbscan, and, optic, such, a, the, concept, of, core, distance, and, reachability, distance, which, are, used, for, local, density, estimation, content, basic, idea, formal, advantage, disadvantage, and, extension, reference, basic, idea, edit, basic, idea, of, lof, comparing, the, local, density, of, a, point, with, the, density, of, it, neighbor, a, ha, a, much, lower, density, than, it, neighbor, a, indicated, by, the, title, the, local, outlier, factor, is, based, on, a, concept, of, a, local, density, where, locality, is, given, by, nearest, neighbor, whose, distance, is, used, to, estimate, the, density, by, comparing, the, local, density, of, an, object, to, the, local, density, of, it, neighbor, one, can, identify, region, of, similar, density, and, point, that, have, a, substantially, lower, density, than, their, neighbor, these, are, considered, to, be, outlier, the, local, density, is, estimated, by, the, typical, distance, at, which, a, point, can, be, reached, from, it, neighbor, the, definition, of, reachability, distance, used, in, lof, is, an, additional, measure, to, produce, more, stable, result, within, cluster, formal, edit, let, be, the, distance, of, the, object, to, the, nearest, neighbor, note, that, the, set, of, the, k, nearest,

reachability, distance, object, b, and, c, have, the, same, reachability, distance, while, d, is, not, a, k, nearest, neighbor, this, distance, is, used, to, define, what, is, called, reachability, distance, in, word, the, reachability, distance, of, an, object, from, is, the, true, distance, of, the, two, object, but, at, least, the, of, object, that, belong, to, the, k, nearest, neighbor, of, the, core, of, see, dbscan, cluster, analysis, are, considered, to, be, equally, distant, the, reason, for, this, distance, is, to, get, more, stable, result, note, that, this, is, not, a, distance, in, the, mathematical, definition, since, it, is, not, symmetric, while, it, is, a, common, mistake, to, always, use, the, this, yield, a, slightly, different, method, referred, to, a, the, local, reachability, density, of, an, object, is, defined, by, which, is, the, inverse, of, the, average, reachability, distance, of, the, object, from, it, neighbor, note, that, it, is, not, the, average, reachability, of, the, neighbor, from, which, by, definition, would, be, the, but, the, distance, at, which, it, can, be, reached, from, it, neighbor, with, duplicate, point, this, value, can, become, infinite, the, local, reachability, density, are, then, compared, with, those, of, the, neighbor, using, which, is, the, average, local, reachability, density, of, the, neighbor, divided, by, the, object, own, local, reachability, density, a, value, of, approximately, indicates, that, the, object, is, comparable, to, it, neighbor, and, thus, not, an, outlier, a, value, below, indicates, a,

a, comparable, density, to, the, outlier, close, to, the, bottom, left, cluster, they, are, detected, correctly, due, to, the, local, approach, lof, is, able, to, identify, outlier, in, a, data, set, that, would, not, be, outlier, in, another, area, of, the, data, set, for, example, a, point, at, a, small, distance, to, a, very, dense, cluster, is, an, outlier, while, a, point, within, a, sparse, cluster, might, exhibit, similar, distance, to, it, neighbor, while, the, geometric, intuition, of, lof, is, only, applicable, to, vector, space, the, algorithm, can, be, applied, in, any, context, a, dissimilarity, function, can, be, defined, it, ha, experimentally, been, shown, to, work, very, well, in, numerous, setup, often, outperforming, the, competitor, for, example, in, network, intrusion,

are, continuous, curve, rather, than, discrete, vector, also, early, work, on, matrix, factorization, wa, performed, by, a, finnish, group, of, researcher, in, the, middle, of, the, under, the, name, positive, matrix, factorization, it, became, more, widely, known, a, matrix, factorization, after, lee, and, seung, investigated, the, property, of, the, algorithm, and, published, some, simple, and, useful, algorithm, for, two, type, of, factorization, background, edit, let, matrix, v, be, the, product, of, the, matrix, w, and, h, matrix, multiplication, can, be, implemented, a, computing, the, column, vector, of, v, a, linear, combination, of, the, column, vector, in, w, using, coefficient, supplied, by, column, of, that, is, each, column, of, v, can, be, computed, a, follows, where, vi, is, the, ith, column, vector, of, the, product, matrix, v, and, hi, is, the, ith, column, vector, of, the, matrix, when, multiplying, matrix, the, dimension, of, the, factor, matrix, may, be, significantly, lower, than, those, of, the, product, matrix, and, it, is, this, property, that, form, the, basis, of, nmf, nmf, generates, factor, with, significantly, reduced, dimension, compared, to, the, original, matrix, for, example, if, v, is, an, matrix, w, is, an, matrix, and, h, is, a, matrix, then, p, can, be, significantly, le, than, both, m, and, here, an, example, based, on, a, application, let, the, input, matrix, the, matrix, to, be, factored, be, v, with, row, and, column, where, word, are, in, row, and, document, are, in, column, that, is, we, have, document, indexed, by, word, it, follows, that, a, column, vector, v, in, v, represents, a, document, assume, we, ask, the, algorithm, to, find, feature, in, order, to, generate, a, feature, matrix, w, with, row, and, column, and, a, coefficient, matrix, h, with, row, and, column, the, product, of, w, and, h, is, a, matrix, with, row, and, column, the, same, shape, a, the, input, matrix, v, and, if, the, factorization, worked, also, a, reasonable, approximation, to, the, input, matrix, from, the, treatment, of, matrix, multiplication, above, it, follows, that, each, column, in, the, product, matrix, wh, is, a, linear, combination, of, the, column, vector, in, the, feature, matrix, w, with, coefficient, supplied, by, the, coefficient, matrix, this, last, point, is, the, basis, of, nmf, because, we, can, consider, each, original, document, in, our, example, a, being, built, from, a, small, set, of, hidden, feature, nmf, generates, these, feature, it, useful, to, think, of, each, feature, column, vector, in, the, feature, matrix, w, a, a, document, archetype, comprising, a, set, of, word, where, each, word, cell, value, defines, the, word, rank, in, the, feature, the, higher, a, word, cell, value, the, higher, the, word, rank, in, the, feature, a, column, in, the, coefficient, matrix, h, represents, an, original, document, with, a, cell, value, defining, the, document, rank, for, a, feature, this, follows, because, each, row, in, h, represents, a, feature, we, can, now, reconstruct, a, document, column, vector, from, our, input, matrix, by, a, linear, combination, of, our, feature, column, vector, in, w, where, each, feature, is, weighted, by, the, feature, cell, value, from, the, document, column, in, type, edit, approximate, matrix, factorization, edit, usually, the, number, of, column, of, w, and, the, number, of, row, of, h, in, nmf, are, selected, so, the, product, wh, will, become, an, approximation, to, the, full, decomposition, of, v, then, amount, to, the, two, matrix, w, and, h, a, well, a, a, residual, u, such, that, v, wh, u, the, element, of, the, residual, matrix, can, either, be, negative, or, positive, when, w, and, h, are, smaller, than, v, they, become, easier, to, store, and, manipulate, another, reason, for, factorizing, v, into, smaller, matrix, w, and, h, is, that, if, one, is, able, to, approximately, represent, the, element, of, v, by, significantly, le, data, then, one, ha, to, infer, some, latent, structure, in, the, data, convex, matrix, factorization, edit, in, standard, nmf, matrix, factor, w, can, be, anything, in, that, space, convex, nmf, restricts, to, a, be, convex, combination, of, the, input, data, vector, this, greatly, improves, the, quality, of, data, representation, of, furthermore, the, resulting, matrix, factor, h, becomes, more, sparse, and, orthogonal, nonnegative, rank, factorization, edit, in, case, the, nonnegative, rank, of, v, is, equal, to, it, actual, rank, is, called, a, nonnegative, rank, factorization, the, problem, of, finding, the, nrf, of, v, if, it, exists, is, known, to, be, different, cost, function, and, regularization, edit, there, are, different, type, of, matrix, factorization, the, different, type, arise, from, using, different, cost, function, for, measuring, the, divergence, between, v, and, wh, and, possibly, by, regularization, of, the, w, h, matrix, two, simple, divergence, function, studied, by, lee, and, seung, are, the, squared, error, or, frobenius, norm, and, an, extension, of, the, divergence, to, positive, matrix, the, original, divergence, is, defined, on, probability, distribution, each, divergence, lead, to, a, different, nmf, algorithm, usually, minimizing, the, divergence, using, iterative, update, rule, the, factorization, problem, in, the, squared, error, version, of, nmf, may, be, stated, a, given, a, matrix, find, nonnegative, matrix, w, and, h, that, minimize, the, function, another, type, of, nmf, for, image, is, based, on, the, total, variation, norm, when, regularization, akin, to, lasso, is, added, to, nmf, with, the, mean, squared, error, cost, function, the, resulting, problem, may, be, called, sparse, coding, due, to, the, similarity, to, the, sparse, coding, problem, although, it, may, also, still, be, referred, to, a, nmf, online, nmf, edit, many, standard, nmf, algorithm, analyze, all, the, data, together, the, whole, matrix, is, available, from, the, start, this, may, be, unsatisfactory, in, application, where, there, are, too, many, data, to, fit, into, memory, or, where, the, data, are, provided, in, streaming, fashion, one, such, use, is, for, collaborative, filtering, in, recommendation, system, where, there, may, be, many, user, and, many, item, to, recommend, and, it, would, be, inefficient, to, recalculate, everything, when, one, user, or, one, item, is, added, to, the, system, the, cost, function, for, optimization, in, these, case, may, or, may, not, be, the, same, a, for, standard, nmf, but, the, algorithm, need, to, be, rather, different, algorithm, edit, there, are, several, way, in, which, the, w, and, h, may, be, found, lee, and, seung, multiplicative, update, rule, ha, been, a, popular, method, due, to, the, simplicity, of, implementation, since, then, a, few, other, algorithmic, approach, have, been, developed, some, successful, algorithm, are, based, on, alternating, least, square, in, each, step, of, such, an, algorithm, first, h, is, fixed, and, w, found, by, a, least, square, solver, then, w, is, fixed, and, h, is, found, analogously, the, procedure, used, to, solve, for, w, and, h, may, be, the, same, or, different, a, some, nmf, variant, regularize, one, of, w, and, specific, approach, include, the, projected, gradient, descent, method, the, active, set, method, and, the, block, principal, pivoting, method, among, several, others, the, currently, available, algorithm, are, a, they, can, only, guarantee, finding, a, local, minimum, rather, than, a, global, minimum, of, the, cost, function, a, provably, optimal, algorithm, is, unlikely, in, the, near, future, a, the, problem, ha, been, shown, to, generalize, the, clustering, problem, which, is, known, to, be, however, a, in, many, other, data, mining, application, a, local, minimum, may, still, prove, to, be, useful, exact, nmf, edit, exact, solution, for, the, variant, of, nmf, can, be, expected, in, polynomial, time, when, additional, constraint, hold, for, matrix, a, polynomial, time, algorithm, for, solving, nonnegative, rank, factorization, if, v, contains, a, monomial, sub, matrix, of, rank, equal, to, it, rank, wa, given, by, campbell, and, poole, in, kalofolias, and, gallopoulos, solved, the, symmetric, counterpart, of, this, problem, where, v, is, symmetric, and, contains, a, diagonal, principal, sub, matrix, of, rank, their, algorithm, run, in, o, time, in, the, dense, case, arora, ge, halpern, mimno, moitra, sontag, wu, zhu, give, a, polynomial, time, algorithm, for, exact, nmf, that, work, for, the, case, where, one, of, the, factor, w, satisfies, the, separability, condition, relation, to, other, technique, edit, in, learning, the, part, of, object, by, matrix, factorization, lee, and, seung, proposed, nmf, mainly, for, decomposition, of, image, it, compare, nmf, to, vector, quantization, and, principal, component, analysis, and, show, that, although, the, three, technique, may, be, written, a, factorization, they, implement, different, constraint, and, therefore, produce, different, result, nmf, a, a, probabilistic, graphical, model, visible, unit, v, are, connected, to, hidden, unit, h, through, weight, w, so, that, v, is, generated, from, a, probability, distribution, with, mean, it, wa, later, shown, that, some, type, of, nmf, are, an, instance, of, a, more, general, probabilistic, model, called, multinomial, pca, when, nmf, is, obtained, by, minimizing, the, divergence, it, is, in, fact, equivalent, to, another, instance, of, multinomial, pca, probabilistic, latent, semantic, analysis, trained, by, maximum, likelihood, estimation, that, method, is, commonly, used, for, analyzing, and, clustering, textual, data, and, is, also, related, to, the, latent, class, model, nmf, with, the, objective, is, equivalent, to, a, relaxed, form, of, clustering, the, matrix, factor, w, contains, cluster, centroid, and, h, contains, cluster, membership, indicator, this, provides, a, theoretical, foundation, for, using, nmf, for, data, clustering, however, doe, not, enforce, on, it, centroid, so, the, closest, analogy, is, in, fact, with, nmf, can, be, seen, a, a, directed, graphical, model, with, one, layer, of, observed, random, variable, and, one, layer, of, hidden, random, variable, nmf, extends, beyond, matrix, to, tensor, of, arbitrary, order, this, extension, may, be, viewed, a, a, counterpart, to, the, parafac, model, other, extension, of, nmf, include, joint, factorisation, of, several, data, matrix, and, tensor, where, some, factor, are, shared, such, model, are, useful, for, sensor, fusion, and, relational, learning, nmf, is, an, instance, of, nonnegative, quadratic, programming, nqp, just, like, the, support, vector, machine, svm, however, svm, and, nmf, are, related, at, a, more, intimate, level, than, that, of, nqp, which, allows, direct, application, of, the, solution, algorithm, developed, for, either, of, the, two, method, to, problem, in, both, domain, uniqueness, edit, the, factorization, is, not, unique, a, matrix, and, it, inverse, can, be, used, to, transform, the, two, factorization, matrix, by, if, the, two, new, matrix, and, are, they, form, another, parametrization, of, the, factorization, the, of, and, applies, at, least, if, b, is, a, monomial, matrix, in, this, simple, case, it, will, just, correspond, to, a, scaling, and, a, permutation, more, control, over, the, of, nmf, is, obtained, with, sparsity, constraint, clustering, property, edit, nmf, ha, an, inherent, clustering, property, it, automatically, cluster, the, column, of, input, data, more, specifically, the, approximation, of, by, is, achieved, by, minimizing, the, error, function, subject, to, if, we, add, additional, orthogonality, constraint, on, then, the, above, minimization, is, identical, to, the, minimization, of, clustering, except, for, the, constraint, furthermore, the, computed, give, the, cluster, indicator, if, that, fact, indicates, input, data, to, cluster, and, the, computed, give, the, cluster, centroid, the, column, give, the, cluster, centroid, of, cluster, when, the, orthogonality, is, not, explicitly, imposed, the, orthogonality, may, hold, to, a, large, extent, in, which, case, the, clustering, property, hold, too, a, may, be, found, in, some, practical, application, of, nmf, citation, needed, when, the, error, function, to, be, used, is, divergence, nmf, is, identical, to, the, probabilistic, latent, semantic,

is, proposed, it, achieves, better, overall, prediction, accuracy, by, introducing, the, concept, of, weight, speech, denoising, edit, speech, denoising, ha, been, a, long, lasting, problem, in, audio, signal, processing, there, are, lot, of, algorithm, for, denoising, if, the, noise, is, stationary, for, example, the, wiener, filter, is, suitable, for, additive, gaussian, noise, however, if, the, noise, is, the, classical, denoising, algorithm, usually, have, poor, performance, because, the, statistical, information, of, the, noise, is, difficult, to, estimate, schmidt, et, al, use, nmf, to, do, speech, denoising, under, noise, which, is, completely, different, from, classical, statistical, key, idea, is, that, clean, speech, signal, can, be, sparsely, represented, by, a, speech, dictionary, but, noise, can, not, similarly, noise, can, also, be, sparsely, represented, by, a, noise, dictionary, but, speech, can, not, the, algorithm, for, nmf, denoising, go, a, follows, two, dictionary, one, for, speech, and, one, for, noise, need, to, be, trained, offline, once, a, noisy, speech, is, given, we, first, calculate, the, magnitude, of, the, second, separate, it, into, two, part, via, nmf, one, can, be, sparsely, represented, by, the, speech, dictionary, and, the, other, part, can, be, sparsely, represented, by, the, noise, dictionary, third, the, part, that, is, represented, by, the, speech, dictionary, will, be, the, estimated, clean, speech, bioinformatics, edit, nmf, ha, been, successfully, applied, in, bioinformatics, for, clustering, gene, expression,

online, machine, learning, see, also, reference, external, link, a, prototypical, online, supervised, learning, algorithm, edit, in, the, setting, of, supervised, learning, or, learning, from, example, we, are, interested, in, learning, a, function, where, is, thought, of, a, a, space, of, input, and, a, a, space, of, output, that, predicts, well, on, instance, that, are, drawn, from, a, joint, probability, distribution, on, in, this, setting, we, are, given, a, loss, function, such, that, measure, the, difference, between, the, predicted, value, and, the, true, value, the, ideal, goal, is, to, select, a, function, where, is, a, space, of, function, called, a, hypothesis, space, so, a, to, minimize, the, expected, risk, in, reality, the, learner, never, know, the, true, distribution, over, instance, instead, the, learner, usually, ha, access, to, a, training, set, of, example, that, are, assumed, to, have, been, drawn, from, the, true, distribution, a, common, paradigm, in, this, situation, is, to, estimate, a, function, through, empirical, risk, minimization, or, regularized, empirical, risk, minimization, usually, tikhonov, regularization, the, choice, of, loss, function, here, give, rise, to, several, learning, algorithm, such, a, regularized, least, square, and, support, vector, machine, the, above, paradigm, is, not, to, the, online, learning, setting, though, a, it, requires, complete, a, priori, knowledge, of, the, entire, training, set, in, the, pure, online, learning, approach, the, learning, algorithm, should, update, a, sequence, of, function, in, a, way, such, that, the, function, depends, only, on, the, previous, function, and, the, next, data, point, this, approach, ha, low, memory, requirement, in, the, sense, that, it, only, requires, storage, of, a, representation, of, the, current, function, and, the, next, data, point, a, related, approach, that, ha, larger, memory, requirement, allows, to, depend, on, and, all, previous, data, point, we, focus, solely, on, the, former, approach, here, and, we, consider, both, the, case, where, the, data, is, coming, from, an, infinite, stream, and, the, case, where, the, data, is, coming, from, a, finite, training, set, in, which, case, the, online, learning, algorithm, may, make, multiple, pass, through, the, data, the, algorithm, and, it, interpretation, edit, here, we, outline, a, prototypical, online, learning, algorithm, in, the, supervised, learning, setting, and, we, discus, several, interpretation, of, this, algorithm, for, simplicity, consider, the, case, where, and, is, the, set, of, all, linear, functionals, from, into, we, are, working, with, a, linear, kernel, and, function, can, be, identified, with, vector, furthermore, assume, that, is, a, convex, differentiable, loss, function, an, online, learning, algorithm, satisfying, the, low, memory, property, discussed, above, consists, of, the, following, iteration, where, is, the, gradient, of, the, loss, for, the, next, data, point, evaluated, at, the, current, linear, functional, and, is, a, parameter, in, the, case, of, an, infinite, stream, of, data, one, can, run, this, iteration, in, principle, forever, and, in, the, case, of, a, finite, but, large, set, of, data, one, can, consider, a, single, pas, or, multiple, pass, epoch, through, the, data, interestingly, enough, the, above, simple, iterative, online, learning, algorithm, ha, three, distinct, interpretation, each, of, which, ha, distinct, implication, about, the, predictive, quality, of, the, sequence, of, function, the, first, interpretation, considers, the, above, iteration, a, an, instance, of, the, stochastic, gradient, descent, method, applied, to, the, problem, of, minimizing, the, expected, risk, defined, above, indeed, in, the, case, of, an, infinite, stream, of, data, since, the, example, are, assumed, to, be, drawn, from, the, distribution, the, sequence, of, gradient, of, in, the, above, iteration, are, an, sample, of, stochastic, estimate, of, the, gradient, of, the, expected, risk, and, therefore, one, can, apply, complexity, result, for, the, stochastic, gradient, descent, method, to, bound, the, deviation, where, is, the, minimizer, of, this, interpretation, is, also, valid, in, the, case, of, a, finite, training, set, although, with, multiple, pass, through, the, data, the, gradient, are, no, longer, independent, still, complexity, result, can, be, obtained, in, special, case, the, second, interpretation, applies, to, the, case, of, a, finite, training, set, and, considers, the, above, recursion, a, an, instance, of, the, incremental, gradient, descent, method, to, minimize, the, empirical, risk, since, the, gradient, of, in, the, above, iteration, are, also, stochastic, estimate, of, the, gradient, of, this, interpretation, is, also, related, to, the, stochastic, gradient, descent, method, but, applied, to, minimize, the, empirical, risk, a, opposed, to, the, expected, risk, since, this, interpretation, concern, the, empirical, risk, and, not, the, expected, risk, multiple, pass, through, the, data, are, readily, allowed, and, actually, lead, to, tighter, bound, on, the, deviation, where, is, the, minimizer, of, the, third, interpretation, of, the, above, recursion, is, distinctly, different, from, the, first, two, and, concern, the, case, of, sequential, trial, discussed, above, where, the, data, are, potentially, not, and, can, perhaps, be, selected, in, an, adversarial, manner, at, each, step, of, this, process, the, learner, is, given, an, input, and, make, a, prediction, based, on, the, current, linear, function, only, after, making, this, prediction, doe, the, learner, see, the, true, label, at, which, point, the, learner, is, allowed, to, update, to, since, we, are, not, making, any, distributional, assumption, about, the, data, the, goal, here, is, to, perform, a, well, a, if, we, could, view, the, entire, sequence, of, example, ahead, of, time, that, is, we, would, like, the, sequence, of, function, to, have, low, regret, relative, to, any, vector, in, this, setting, the, above, recursion, can, be, considered, a, an, instance, of, the, online, gradient, descent, method, for, which, there, are, complexity, bound, that, guarantee, regret, it, should, be, noted, that, although, the, three, interpretation, of, this, algorithm, yield, complexity, bound, in, three, distinct, setting, each, bound, depends, on, the, choice, of, sequence, in, a, different, way, and, thus, we, can, not, simultaneously, apply, the, consequence, of, all, three, interpretation, we, must, instead, select, the, sequence, in, a, way, that, is, tailored, for, the, interpretation, that, is, most, relevant, furthermore, the, above, algorithm, and, these, interpretation, can, be, extended, to, the, case, of, a, nonlinear, kernel, by, simply, considering, to, be, the, feature, space, associated, with, the, kernel, although, in,

reinforcement, learning, method, are, studied, is, called, approximate, dynamic, programming, the, problem, ha, been, studied, in, the, theory, of, optimal, control, though, most, study, are, concerned, with, the, existence, of, optimal, solution, and, their, characterization, and, not, with, the, learning, or, approximation, aspect, in, economics, and, game, theory, reinforcement,

reinforcement, learning, model, consists, of, a, set, of, environment, state, a, set, of, action, rule, of, transitioning, between, state, rule, that, determine, the, scalar, immediate, reward, of, a, transition, and, rule, that, describe, what, the, agent, observes, the, rule, are, often, stochastic, the, observation, typically, involves, the, scalar, immediate, reward, associated, with, the, last, transition, in, many, work, the, agent, is, also, assumed, to, observe, the, current, environmental, state, in, which, case, we, talk, about, full, observability, whereas, in, the, opposing, case, we, talk, about, partial, observability, sometimes, the, set, of, action, available, to, the, agent, is, restricted, you, can, not, spend, more, money, than, what, you, posse, a, reinforcement, learning, agent, interacts, with, it, environment, in, discrete, time, step, at, each, time, the, agent, receives, an, observation, which, typically, includes, the, reward, it, then, chooses, an, action, from, the, set, of, action, available, which, is, subsequently, sent, to, the, environment, the, environment, move, to, a, new, state, and, the, reward, associated, with, the, transition, is, determined, the, goal, of, a, reinforcement, learning, agent, is, to, collect, a, much, reward, a, possible, the, agent, can, choose, any, action, a, a, function, of, the, history, and, it, can, even, randomize, it, action, selection, when, the, agent, performance, is, compared, to, that, of, an, agent, which, act, optimally, from, the, beginning, the, difference, in, performance, give, rise, to, the, notion, of, regret, note, that, in, order, to, act, near, optimally, the, agent, must, reason, about, the, long, term, consequence, of, it, action, in, order, to, maximize, my, future, income, i, had, better, go, to, school, now, although, the, immediate, monetary, reward, associated, with, this, might, be, negative, thus, reinforcement, learning, is, particularly, well, suited, to, problem, which, include, a, versus, reward, it, ha, been, applied, successfully, to, various, problem, including, robot, control, elevator, scheduling, telecommunication, backgammon, and, checker, sutton, and, barto, chapter, two, component, make, reinforcement, learning, powerful, the, use, of, sample, to, optimize, performance, and, the, use, of, function, approximation, to, deal, with, large, environment, thanks, to, these, two, key, component, reinforcement, learning, can, be, used, in, large, environment, in, any, of, the, following, situation, a, model, of, the, environment, is, known, but, an, analytic, solution, is, not, available, only, a, simulation, model, of, the, environment, is, given, the, subject, of, optimization, the, only, way, to, collect, information, about, the, environment, is, by, interacting, with, it, the, first, two, of, these, problem, could, be, considered, planning, problem, since, some, form, of, the, model, is, available, while, the, last, one, could, be, considered, a, a, genuine, learning, problem, however, under, a, reinforcement, learning, methodology, both, planning, problem, would, be, converted, to, machine, learning, problem, exploration, edit, the, reinforcement, learning, problem, a, described, requires, clever, exploration, mechanism, randomly, selecting, action, without, reference, to, an, estimated, probability, distribution, is, known, to, give, rise, to, very, poor, performance, the, case, of, small, finite, mdps, is, relatively, well, understood, by, now, however, due, to, the, lack, of, algorithm, that, would, provably, scale, well, with, the, number, of, state, or, scale, to, problem, with, infinite, state, space, in, practice, people, resort, to, simple, exploration, method, one, such, method, is, when, the, agent, chooses, the, action, that, it, belief, ha, the, best, effect, with, probability, and, it, chooses, an, action, uniformly, at, random, otherwise, here, is, a, tuning, parameter, which, is, sometimes, changed, either, according, to, a, fixed, schedule, making, the, agent, explore, le, a, time, go, by, or, adaptively, based, on, some, heuristic, tokic, palm, algorithm, for, control, learning, edit, even, if, the, issue, of, exploration, is, disregarded, and, even, if, the, state, wa, observable, which, we, assume, from, now, on, the, problem, remains, to, find, out, which, action, are, good, based, on, past, experience, criterion, of, optimality, edit, for, simplicity, assume, for, a, moment, that, the, problem, studied, is, episodic, an, episode, ending, when, some, terminal, state, is, reached, assume, further, that, no, matter, what, course, of, action, the, agent, take, termination, is, inevitable, under, some, additional, mild, regularity, condition, the, expectation, of, the, total, reward, is, then, for, any, policy, and, any, initial, distribution, over, the, state, here, a, policy, refers, to, a, mapping, that, assigns, some, probability, distribution, over, the, action, to, all, possible, history, given, a, fixed, initial, distribution, we, can, thus, assign, the, expected, return, to, policy, where, the, random, variable, denotes, the, return, and, is, defined, by, where, is, the, reward, received, after, the, transition, the, initial, state, is, sampled, at, random, from, and, action, are, selected, by, policy, here, denotes, the, random, time, when, a, terminal, state, is, reached, the, time, when, the, episode, terminates, in, the, case, of, problem, the, return, is, often, discounted, giving, rise, to, the, total, expected, discounted, reward, criterion, here, is, the, since, the, undiscounted, return, is, a, special, case, of, the, discounted, return, from, now, on, we, will, assume, discounting, although, this, look, innocent, enough, discounting, is, in, fact, problematic, if, one, care, about, online, performance, this, is, because, discounting, make, the, initial, time, step, more, important, since, a, learning, agent, is, likely, to, make, mistake, during, the, first, few, step, after, it, life, start, no, uninformed, learning, algorithm, can, achieve, performance, under, discounting, even, if, the, class, of, environment, is, restricted, to, that, of, finite, mdps, this, doe, not, mean, though, that, given, enough, time, a, learning, agent, can, not, figure, how, to, act, if, time, wa, restarted, the, problem, then, is, to, specify, an, algorithm, that, can, be, used, to, find, a, policy, with, maximum, expected, return, from, the, theory, of, mdps, it, is, known, that, without, loss, of, generality, the, search, can, be, restricted, to, the, set, of, the, stationary, policy, a, policy, is, called, stationary, if, the, returned, by, it, depends, only, on, the, last, state, visited, which, is, part, of, the, observation, history, of, the, agent, by, our, simplifying, assumption, in, fact, the, search, can, be, further, restricted, to, deterministic, stationary, policy, a, deterministic, stationary, policy, is, one, which, deterministically, selects, action, based, on, the, current, state, since, any, such, policy, can, be, identified, with, a, mapping, from, the, set, of, state, to, the, set, of, action, these, policy, can, be, identified, with, such, mapping, with, no, loss, of, generality, brute, force, edit, the, brute, force, approach, entail, the, following, two, step, for, each, possible, policy, sample, return, while, following, it, choose, the, policy, with, the, largest, expected, return, one, problem, with, this, is, that, the, number, of, policy, can, be, extremely, large, or, even, infinite, another, is, that, variance, of, the, return, might, be, large, in, which, case, a, large, number, of, sample, will, be, required, to, accurately, estimate, the, return, of, each, policy, these, problem, can, be, ameliorated, if, we, assume, some, structure, and, perhaps, allow, sample, generated, from, one, policy, to, influence, the, estimate, made, for, another, the, two, main, approach, for, achieving, this, are, value, function, estimation, and, direct, policy, search, value, function, approach, edit, value, function, approach, attempt, to, find, a, policy, that, maximizes, the, return, by, maintaining, a, set, of, estimate, of, expected, return, for, some, policy, usually, either, the, current, or, the, optimal, one, these, method, rely, on, the, theory, of, mdps, where, optimality, is, defined, in, a, sense, which, is, stronger, than, the, above, one, a, policy, is, called, optimal, if, it, achieves, the, best, expected, return, from, any, initial, state, initial, distribution, play, no, role, in, this, definition, again, one, can, always, find, an, optimal, policy, amongst, stationary, policy, to, define, optimality, in, a, formal, manner, define, the, value, of, a, policy, by, where, stand, for, the, random, return, associated, with, following, from, the, initial, state, define, a, the, maximum, possible, value, of, where, is, allowed, to, change, a, policy, which, achieves, these, optimal, value, in, each, state, is, called, optimal, clearly, a, policy, optimal, in, this, strong, sense, is, also, optimal, in, the, sense, that, it, maximizes, the, expected, return, since, where, is, a, state, randomly, sampled, from, the, distribution, although, suffice, to, define, optimality, it, will, prove, to, be, useful, to, define, given, a, state, an, action, and, a, policy, the, of, the, pair, under, is, defined, by, where, now, stand, for, the, random, return, associated, with, first, taking, action, in, state, and, following, thereafter, it, is, from, the, theory, of, mdps, that, if, someone, give, u, for, an, optimal, policy, we, can, always, choose, optimal, action, and, thus, act, optimally, by, simply, choosing, the, action, with, the, highest, value, at, each, state, the, function, of, such, an, optimal, policy, is, called, the, optimal, function, and, is, denoted, by, in, summary, the, knowledge, of, the, optimal, function, alone, suffices, to, know, how, to, act, optimally, assuming, full, knowledge, of, the, mdp, there, are, two, basic, approach, to, compute, the, optimal, function, value, iteration, and, policy, iteration, both, algorithm, compute, a, sequence, of, function, which, converge, to, computing, these, function, involves, computing, expectation, over, the, whole, which, is, impractical, for, all, but, the, smallest, finite, mdps, never, mind, the, case, when, the, mdp, is, unknown, in, reinforcement, learning, method, the, expectation, are, approximated, by, averaging, over, sample, and, one, us, function, approximation, technique, to, cope, with, the, need, to, represent, value, function, over, large, space, monte, carlo, method, edit, the, simplest, monte, carlo, method, can, be, used, in, an, algorithm, that, mimic, policy, iteration, policy, iteration, consists, of, two, step, policy, evaluation, and, policy, improvement, the, monte, carlo, method, are, used, in, the, policy, evaluation, step, in, this, step, given, a, stationary, deterministic, policy, the, goal, is, to, compute, the, function, value, or, a, good, approximation, to, them, for, all, pair, assume, for, simplicity, that, the, mdp, is, finite, and, in, fact, a, table, representing, the, fit, into, the, memory, further, assume, that, the, problem, is, episodic, and, after, each, episode, a, new, one, start, from, some, random, initial, state, then, the, estimate, of, the, value, of, a, given, pair, can, be, computed, by, simply, averaging, the, sampled, return, which, originated, from, over, time, given, enough, time, this, procedure, can, thus, construct, a, precise, estimate, of, the, function, this, finish, the, description, of, the, policy, evaluation, step, in, the, policy, improvement, step, a, it, is, done, in, the, standard, policy, iteration, algorithm, the, next, policy, is, obtained, by, computing, a, greedy, policy, with, respect, to, given, a, state, this, new, policy, return, an, action, that, maximizes, in, practice, one, often, avoids, computing, and, storing, the, new, policy, but, us, lazy, evaluation, to, defer, the, computation, of, the, maximizing, action, to, when, they, are, actually, needed, a, few, problem, with, this, procedure, are, a, follows, the, procedure, may, waste, too, much, time, on, evaluating, a, suboptimal, policy, it, us, sample, inefficiently, in, that, a, long, trajectory, is, used, to, improve, the, estimate, only, of, the, single, pair, that, started, the, trajectory, when, the, return, along, the, trajectory, have, high, variance, convergence, will, be, slow, it, work, in, episodic, problem, only, it, work, in, small, finite, mdps, only, temporal, difference, method, edit, the, first, issue, is, easily, corrected, by, allowing, the, procedure, to, change, the, policy, at, all, or, at, some, state, before, the, value, settle, however, good, this, sound, this, may, be, dangerous, a, this, might, prevent, convergence, still, most, current, algorithm, implement, this, idea, giving, rise, to, the, class, of, generalized, policy, iteration, algorithm, we, note, in, passing, that, actor, critic, method, belong, to, this, category, the, second, issue, can, be, corrected, within, the, algorithm, by, allowing, trajectory, to, contribute, to, any, pair, in, them, this, may, also, help, to, some, extent, with, the, third, problem, although, a, better, solution, when, return, have, high, variance, is, to, use, sutton, temporal, difference, td, method, which, are, based, on, the, recursive, bellman, equation, note, that, the, computation, in, td, method, can, be, incremental, when, after, each, transition, the, memory, is, changed, and, the, transition, is, thrown, away, or, batch, when, the, transition, are, collected, and, then, the, estimate, are, computed, once, based, on, a, large, number, of, transition, batch, method, a, prime, example, of, which, is, the, temporal, difference, method, due, to, bradtke, and, barto, may, use, the, information, in, the, sample, better, whereas, incremental, method, are, the, only, choice, when, batch, method, become, infeasible, due, to, their, high, computational, or, memory, complexity, in, addition, there, exist, method, that, try, to, unify, the, advantage, of, the, two, approach, method, based, on, temporal, difference, also, overcome, the, second, but, last, issue, in, order, to, address, the, last, issue, mentioned, in, the, previous, section, function, approximation, method, are, used, in, linear, function, approximation, one, start, with, a, mapping, that, assigns, a, vector, to, each, pair, then, the, action, value, of, a, pair, are, obtained, by, linearly, combining, the, component, of, with, some, weight, the, algorithm, then, adjust, the, weight, instead, of, adjusting, the, value, associated, with, the, individual, pair, however, linear, function, approximation, is, not, the, only, choice, more, recently, method, based, on, idea, from, nonparametric, statistic, which, can, be, seen, to, construct, their, own, feature, have, been, explored, so, far, the, discussion, wa, restricted, to, how, policy, iteration, can, be, used, a, a, basis, of, the, designing, reinforcement, learning, algorithm, equally, importantly, value, iteration, can, also, be, used, a, a, starting, point, giving, rise, to, the, algorithm, watkins, and, it, many, variant, the, problem, with, method, that, use, is, that, they, may, need, highly, precise, estimate, of, the, competing, action, value, which, can, be, hard, to, obtain, when, the, return, are, noisy, though, this, problem, is, mitigated, to, some, extent, by, temporal, difference, method, and, if, one, us, the, compatible, function, approximation, method, more, work, remains, to, be, done, to, increase, generality, and, efficiency, another, problem, specific, to, temporal, difference, method, come, from, their, reliance, on, the, recursive, bellman, equation, most, temporal, difference, method, have, a, parameter, that, allows, one, to, continuously, interpolate, between, method, which, do, not, rely, on, the, bellman, equation, and, the, basic, temporal, difference, method, which, rely, entirely, on, the, bellman, equation, which, can, thus, be, effective, in, palliating, this, issue, direct, policy, search, edit, an, alternative, method, to, find, a, good, policy, is, to, search, directly, in, some, subset, of, the, policy, space, in, which, case, the, problem, becomes, an, instance, of, stochastic, optimization, the, two, approach, available, are, and, method, method, giving, rise, to, the, policy, gradient, method, start, with, a, mapping, from, a, parameter, space, to, the, space, of, policy, given, the, parameter, vector, let, denote, the, policy, associated, to, define, the, performance, function, by, under, mild, condition, this, function, will, be, differentiable, a, a, function, of, the, parameter, vector, if, the, gradient, of, wa, known, one, could, use, gradient, ascent, since, an, analytic, expression, for, the, gradient, is, not, available, one, must, rely, on, a, noisy, estimate, such, an, estimate, can, be, constructed, in, many, way, giving, rise, to, algorithm, like, williams, reinforce, method, which, is, also, known, a, the, likelihood, ratio, method, in, the, optimization, literature, policy, gradient, method, have, received, a, lot, of, attention, in, the, last, couple, of, year, peter, et, al, but, they, remain, an, active, field, an, overview, of, policy, search, method, in, the, context, of, robotics, ha, been, given, by, deisenroth, neumann, and, peter, the, issue, with, many, of, these, method, is, that, they, may, get, stuck, in, local, optimum, a, they, are, based, on, local, search, a, large, class, of, method, avoids, relying, on, gradient, information, these, include, simulated, annealing, search, or, method, of, evolutionary, computation, many, method, can, achieve, in, theory, and, in, the, limit, a, global, optimum, in, a, number, of, case, they, have, indeed, demonstrated, remarkable, performance, the, issue, with, policy, search, method, is, that, they, may, converge, slowly, if, the, information, based, on, which, they, act, is, noisy, for, example, this, happens, when, in, episodic, problem, the, trajectory, are, long, and, the, variance, of, the, return, is, large, a, argued, beforehand, based, method, that, rely, on, temporal, difference, might, help, in, this, case, in, recent, year, several, algorithm, have, been, proposed, following, this, idea, and, were, demonstrated, to, perform, well, in, various, problem, theory, edit, the, theory, for, small, finite, mdps, is, quite, mature, both, the, asymptotic, and, behavior, of, most, algorithm, is, a, mentioned, beforehand, algorithm, with, provably, good, online, performance, addressing, the, exploration, issue, are, known, the, theory, of, large, mdps, need, more, work, efficient, exploration, is, largely, untouched, except, for, the, case, of, bandit, problem, although, performance, bound, appeared, for, many, algorithm, in, the, recent, year, these, bound, are, expected, to, be, rather, loose, and, thus, more, work, is, needed, to, better, understand, the, relative, advantage, a, well, a, the, limitation, of, these, algorithm, for, incremental, algorithm, asymptotic, convergence, issue, have, been, settled, recently, new, incremental, algorithm, have, appeared, which, converge, under, a, much, wider, set, of, condition, than, wa, previously, possible, for, example, when, used, with, arbitrary, smooth, function, approximation, current, research, edit,

sparse, principal, component, analysis, sparse, pca, is, a, specialised, technique, used, in, statistical, analysis, and, in, particular, in, the, analysis, of, multivariate, data, set, it, extends, the, classic, method, of, principal, component, analysis, pca, for, the, reduction, of, dimensionality, of, data, by, adding, sparsity, constraint, on, the, input, variable, ordinary, principal, component, analysis, pca, us, a, vector, space, transform, to, reduce, multidimensional, data, set, to, lower, dimension, it, find, linear, combination, of, input, variable, and, transforms, them, into, new, variable, called, principal, component, that, correspond, to, direction, of, maximal, variance, in, the, data, the, number, of, new, variable, created, by, these, linear, combination, is, usually, much, lower, than, the, number, of, input, variable, in, the, original, dataset, while, still, explaining, most, of, the, variance, present, in, the, data, a, particular, disadvantage, of, ordinary, pca, is, that, the, principal, component, are, usually, linear, combination, of, all, input, variable, sparse, pca, overcomes, this, disadvantage, by, finding, linear, combination, that,

an, example, of, hypothesis, testing, in, high, dimension, using, sparse, pca, reference, mathematical, formulation, edit, consider, a, data, matrix, x, where, each, of, the, p, column, represent, an, input, variable, and, each, of, the, n, row, represents, an, independent, sample, from, data, population, we, assume, each, column, of, x, ha, mean, zero, otherwise, we, can, subtract, mean, from, each, element, of, x, let, be, the, empirical, covariance, matrix, of, x, which, ha, dimension, given, an, integer, k, with, the, sparse, pca, problem, can, be, formulated, a, maximizing, the, variance, along, a, direction, represented, by, vector, while, constraining, it, cardinality, eq, the, first, constraint, specifies, that, v, is, a, unit, vector, in, the, second, constraint, represents, the, norm, of, v, which, is, defined, a, the, number, of, it, component, so, the, second, constraint, specifies, that, the, number, of, component, in, v, is, le, than, or, equal, to, k, which, is, typically, an, integer, that, is, much, smaller, than, dimension, the, optimal, value, of, eq, is, known, a, the, largest, eigenvalue, if, we, take, the, problem, reduces, to, the, ordinary, pca, and, the, optimal, value, becomes, the, largest, eigenvalue, of, covariance, matrix, after, finding, the, optimal, solution, v, we, deflate, to, obtain, a, new, matrix, and, iterate, this, process, to, obtain, further, principal, component, however, unlike, pca, sparse, pca, can, not, guarantee, that, different, principal, component, are, orthogonal, in, order, to, achieve, orthogonality, additional, constraint, must, be, enforced, because, of, the, cardinality, constraint, the, maximization, problem, is, hard, to, solve, exactly, especially, when, dimension, p, is, high, in, fact, the, sparse, pca, problem, in, eq, is, in, the, strong, sense, several, alternative, approach, have, been, proposed, including, a, regression, framework, a, convex, programming, framework, a, generalized, power, method, framework, an, alternating, maximization, framework, greedy, search, and, exact, method, using, technique, bayesian, formulation, framework, semidefinite, programming, relaxation, edit, it, ha, been, proposed, that, sparse, pca, can, be, approximated, by, semidefinite, programming, sdp, let, be, a, symmetric, matrix, we, can, rewrite, the, sparse, pca, problem, a, eq, tr, is, the, matrix, trace, and, represents, the, element, in, matrix, the, last, line, specifies, that, v, ha, matrix, rank, one, and, is, positive, semidefinite, the, last, line, mean, that, we, have, so, eq, is, equivalent, to, eq, if, we, drop, the, rank, constraint, and, relax, the, cardinality, contraint, by, a, convex, constraint, we, get, a, semidefinite, programming, relaxation, which, can, be, solved, efficiently, in, polynomial, time, eq, in, the, second, constraint, is, a, vector, of, one, and, is, the, matrix, whose, element, are, the, absolute, value, of, the, element, of, unfortunately, the, optimal, solution, to, the, relaxed, problem, eq, is, not, guaranteed, to, have, rank, one, in, that, case, can, be, truncated, to, retain, only, the, dominant, eigenvector, application, edit, financial, data, analysis, edit, suppose, ordinary, pca, is, applied, to, a, dataset, where, each, input, variable, represents, a, different, asset, it, may, generate, principal, component, that, are, weighted, combination, of, all, the, asset, in, contrast, sparse, pca, would, produce, principal, component, that, are, weighted, combination, of, only, a, few, input, asset, so, one, can, easily, interpret, it, meaning, furthermore, if, one, us, a, trading, strategy, based, on, these, principal, component, fewer, asset, imply, le, transaction, cost, biology, edit, consider, a, dataset, where, each, input, variable, corresponds, to, a, specific, gene, sparse, pca, can, produce, a, principal, component, that, involves, only, a, few, gene, so, researcher, can, focus, on, these, specific, gene, for, further, analysis, sparse, pca, in, high, dimension, edit, contemporary, datasets, often, have, the, number, of, input, variable, p, comparable, with, or, even, much, larger, than, the, number, of, sample, n, it, ha, been, shown, that, if, doe, not, converge, to, zero, the, classical, pca, is, not, consistent, in, other, word, if, we, let, in, eq, then, the, optimal, value, doe, not, converge, to, the, largest, eigenvalue, of, data, population, when, the, sample, size, and, the, optimal, solution, doe, not, converge, to, the, direction, of, maximum,
