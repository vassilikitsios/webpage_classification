of, mesothelioma, which, is, a, cancer, of, the, serous, membrane, usually, the, serous, membrane, surrounding, the, lung, other, substance, in, this, category, including, both, naturally, occurring, and, synthetic, fiber, such, a, wollastonite, attapulgite, glass, wool, and, rock, wool, are, believed, to, have, similar, effect, particulate, material, that, cause, cancer, include, powdered, metallic, cobalt, and, nickel, and, crystalline, silica, quartz, cristobalite, and, tridymite, usually, physical, carcinogen, must, get, inside, the, body, such, a, through, inhaling, tiny, piece, and, require, year, of, exposure, to, develop, cancer, physical, trauma, resulting, in, cancer, is, relatively, rare, claim, that, breaking, bone, resulted, in, bone, cancer, for, example, have, never, been, proven, similarly, physical, trauma, is, not, accepted, a, a, cause, for, cervical, cancer, breast, cancer, or, brain, cancer, one, accepted, source, is, frequent, application, of, hot, object, to, the, body, it, is, possible, that, repeated, burn, on, the, same, part, of, the, body, such, a, those, produced, by, kanger, and, kairo, heater, charcoal, hand, warmer, may, produce, skin, cancer, especially, if, carcinogenic, chemical, are, also, present, frequently, drinking, scalding, hot, tea, may, produce, esophageal, cancer, generally, it, is, believed, that, the, cancer, arises, or, a, cancer, is, encouraged, during, the, process, of, repairing, the, trauma, rather, than, the, cancer, being, caused, directly, by, the, trauma, however, repeated, injury, to, the, same, tissue, might, promote, excessive, cell, proliferation, which, could, then, increase, the, odds, of, a, cancerous, mutation, there, is, no, evidence, that, inflammation, itself, cause, cancer, yet, inflammation, can, contribute, to, proliferation, survival, and, migration, of, cancer, cell, by, influencing, the, microenvironment, around, tumor, hormone, edit, some, hormone, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, cancer, by, promoting, cell, proliferation, growth, factor, and, their, binding, protein, play, a, key, role, in, cancer, cell, proliferation, differentiation, and, apoptosis, suggesting, possible, involvement, in, carcinogenesis, hormone, are, important, agent, in, cancer, such, a, cancer, of, the, breast, endometrium, prostate, ovary, and, testis, and, also, of, thyroid, cancer, and, bone, cancer, for, example, the, daughter, of, woman, who, have, breast, cancer, have, significantly, higher, level, of, estrogen, and, progesterone, than, the, daughter, of, woman, without, breast, cancer, these, higher, hormone, level, may, explain, why, these, woman, have, higher, risk, of, breast, cancer, even, in, the, absence, of, a, gene, similarly, men, of, african, ancestry, have, significantly, higher, level, of, testosterone, than, men, of, european, ancestry, and, have, a, correspondingly, much, higher, level, of, prostate, cancer, men, of, asian, ancestry, with, the, lowest, level, of, androstanediol, glucuronide, have, the, lowest, level, of, prostate, cancer, other, factor, are, also, relevant, obese, people, have, higher, level, of, some, hormone, associated, with, cancer, and, a, higher, rate, of, those, cancer, woman, who, take, hormone, replacement, therapy, have, a, higher, risk, of, developing, cancer, associated, with, those, hormone, on, the, other, hand, people, who, exercise, far, more, than, average, have, lower, level, of, these, hormone, and, lower, risk, of, cancer, osteosarcoma, may, be, promoted, by, growth, hormone, some, treatment, and, prevention, approach, leverage, this, cause, by, artificially, reducing, hormone, level, and, thus, discouraging, cancer, other, edit, excepting, the, rare, transmission, that, occur, with, pregnancy, and, only, a, marginal, few, organ, donor, cancer, is, generally, not, a, transmissible, disease, the, main, reason, for, this, is, tissue, graft, rejection, caused, by, mhc, incompatibility, in, human, and, other, vertebrate, the, immune, system, us, mhc, antigen, to, differentiate, between, self, and, cell, because, these, antigen, are, different, from, person, to,

environment, feeble, protection, against, rnase, and, other, nuclease, poor, chemical, stability, and, common, dissociation, from, vector, in, fact, the, major, obstacle, to, clinical, application, is, the, uncertainty, about, how, to, deliver, therapeutic, dna, antisense, oligonucleotides, and, rna, microrna, sirna, with, maximal, therapeutic, impact, due, to, systemic, loss, of, cargo, from, traditional, vector, this, method, offer, an, unprecedented, opportunity, to, overcome, these, problem, a, these, nanoconjugates, can, readily, interact, with, biomolecules, on, both, the, surface, of, cell, and, inside, cell, for, longer, period, of, time, due, to, their, small, size, and, protective, environment, for, oligonucleotides, provided, by, the, metal, nanoparticle, core, the, are, also, highly, soluble, homogenous, and, stable, and, are, not, prone, to, aggregation, in, addition, these, nanoparticles, are, thermodynamically, stable, and, can, remain, inside, cell, for, long, period, of, time, and, at, low, concentration, secondly, are, capable, of, efficiently, silencing, single, gene, expression, exogenous, sirna, and, endogenous, mirnas, thirdly, it, allows, detection, of, the, signal, while, yielding, a, quantifiable, fluorescence, directly, proportional, to, the, level, of, gene, silencing, this, can, be, used, to, track, the, silencing, event, inside, the, cell, a, they, occur, all, this, is, achieved, in, a, simple, approach, that, can, be, straightforwardly, adapted, and, tailored, to, any, specific, target, finally, a, significant, attribute, of, these, is, the, ability, to, attain, similar, level, of, inhibition, of, gene, expression, with, lower, amount, than, those, of, free, oligonucleotides, without, increasing, cell, death, this, extraordinary, efficiency, occurs, probably, due, to, the, large, payload, capacity, of, the, np, and, the, longer, when, inside, the, cell, the, may, represent, in, the, near, future, an, economically, viable, and, production, for, a, cell, and, system, contrary, to, conventional, gene, delivery, chemistry, which, is, often, associated, to, systemic, toxicity, and, adverse, effect, a, well, a, lack, of,

therefore, autophagy, can, also, regulate, the, health, in, time, of, oxidative, stress, autophagy, can, be, induced, by, ro, level, through, many, different, pathway, in, the, cell, in, an, attempt, to, dispose, of, harmful, organelle, and, prevent, damage, such, a, carcinogen, without, inducing, apoptosis, autophagic, cell, death, can, be, prompted, by, the, over, expression, of, autophagy, where, the, cell, digest, too, much, of, itself, in, an, attempt, to, minimize, the, damage, and, can, no, longer, survive, when, this, type, of, cell, death, occurs, an, increase, or, loss, of, control, of, autophagy, regulating, gene, is, commonly, thus, once, a, more, understanding, of, autophagic, cell, death, is, attained, and, relation, to, ro, this, form, of, programmed, cell, death, may, serve, a, a, future, cancer, therapy, autophagy, and, apoptosis, are, two, different, cell, death, mechanism, brought, on, by, high, level, of, ro, in, the, cell, however, autophagy, and, apoptosis, rarely, act, through, strictly, independent, pathway, there, is, a, clear, connection, between, ro, and, autophagy, and, a, correlation, seen, between, excessive, amount, of, ro, leading, to, apoptosis, the, depolarization, of, the, mitochondrial, membrane, is, also, characteristic, of, the, initiation, of, autophagy, when, mitochondrion, are, damaged, and, begin, to, release, ro, autophagy, is, initiated, to, dispose, of, the, damaging, organelle, if, a, drug, target, mitochondrion, and, creates, ro, autophagy, may, dispose, of, so, many, mitochondrion, and, other, damaged, organelle, that, the, cell, is, no, longer, viable, the, extensive, amount, of, ro, and, mitochondrial, damage, may, also, signal, for, apoptosis, the, balance, of, autophagy, within, the, cell, and, the, crosstalk, between, autophagy, and, apoptosis, mediated, by, ro, is, crucial, for, a, survival, this, crosstalk, and, connection, between, autophagy, and, apoptosis, could, be, a, mechanism, targeted, by, cancer, therapy, or, used, in, combination, therapy, for, highly, resistant, cancer, ro, tumor, cell, invasion, angiogenesis, and, metastasis, edit, after, growth, factor, stimulation, of, rtks, ro, can, trigger, activation, of, signaling, pathway, involved, in, cell, migration, and, invasion, such, a, member, of, the, mitogen, activated, protein, kinase, mapk, family, regulated, kinase, erk, terminal, kinase, jnk, and, mapk, ro, can, also, promote, migration, by, augmenting, phosphorylation, of, the, focal, adhesion, kinase, fak, and, paxilin, both, in, vitro, and, in, vivo, ro, have, been, shown, to, induce, transcription, factor, and, modulate, signaling, molecule, involved, in, angiogenesis, mmp, vegf, and, metastasis, upregulation, of, akt, and, downregulation, of, pten, ro, chronic, inflammation, and, cancer, edit, experimental, and, epidemiologic, research, over, the, past, several, year, ha, indicated, close, association, among, ro, chronic, inflammation, and, cancer, ro, induces, chronic, inflammation, by, the, induction, of, inflammatory, cytokine, interleukin, chemokines, and, transcription, factor, these, chemokines, and, chemokine, receptor, in, turn, promote, invasion, and, metastasis, of, various, tumor, type, ro, and, cancer, therapy, edit, both, and, strategy, have, been, developed, with, the, former, being, predominantly, used, cancer, cell, with, elevated, ro, level, depend, heavily, on, the, antioxidant, defense, system, drug, further, increase, cellular, ro, stress, level, either, by, direct, motexafin, gadolinium, elesclomol, or, by, agent, that, abrogate, the, inherent, antioxidant, system, such, a, sod, inhibitor, and, gsh, inhibitor, peitc, buthionine, sulfoximine, bso, the, result, is, an, overall, increase, in, endogenous, ro, which, when, above, a, cellular, tolerability, threshold, may, induce, cell, death, on, the, other, hand, normal, cell, appear, to, have, under, lower, basal, stress, and, reserve, a, higher, capacity, to, cope, with, additional, insult, than, cancer, cell, do, therefore, the, elevation, of, ro, in, all, cell, can, be, used, to, achieve, the, selective, killing, of, cancer, cell, radiotherapy, also, relies, on, ro, toxicity, to, eradicate, tumor, cell, radiotherapy, us, a, well, a, heavy, particle, radiation, such, a, proton, and, neutron, to, induce, cell, death, and, mitotic, failure, due, to, the, dual, role, of, ro, both, prooxidant, and, anticancer, agent, have, been, developed, however, modulation, of, ro, signaling, alone, seems, not, to, be, an, ideal, approach, due, to, adaptation, of, cancer, cell, to, ro, stress, redundant, pathway, for, supporting, cancer, growth, and, toxicity, from, anticancer, drug, combination, of, drug, with, pharmaceutical, that, can, break, the, redox, adaptation, could, be, a, better, strategy, for, enhancing, cancer, cell, cytotoxicity, james, watson, and, others, have, proposed, that, lack, of, intracellular, ro, due, to, a, lack, of, physical, exercise, may, contribute, to, the, malignant, progression, of, cancer, because, spike, of, ro, are, needed, to, correctly, fold, protein, in, the, endoplasmatic, reticulum, and, low, ro, level, may, thus, aspecifically, hamper, the, formation, of, tumor, suppressor, protein, since, physical, exercise, induces, temporary, spike, of, ro, this,

morphological, and, phenotypic, profile, including, cellular, morphology, gene, expression, metabolism, motility, proliferation, and, metastatic, potential, this, phenomenon, occurs, both, between, tumour, heterogeneity, and, within, tumour, heterogeneity, the, heterogeneity, of, cancer, cell, introduces, significant, challenge, in, designing, effective, treatment, strategy, however, research, into, understanding, and, characterizing, heterogeneity, can, allow, for, a, better, understanding, of, the, cause, and, progression, of, disease, in, turn, this, ha, the, potential, to, guide, the, creation, of, more, refined, treatment, strategy, that, incorporate, knowledge, of, heterogeneity, to, yield, higher, efficacy, tumour, heterogeneity, ha, been, observed, in, leukemia, breast,

tumour, cell, these, are, the, cancer, stem, cell, model, and, the, clonal, evolution, model, the, model, are, not, mutually, exclusive, and, it, is, believed, that, they, both, contribute, to, heterogeneity, in, varying, amount, across, different, tumour, type, ability, of, cancer, cell, to, form, tumour, under, the, cancer, stem, cell, and, clonal, evolution, model, of, heterogeneity, cancer, stem, cell, edit, main, article, cancer, stem, cell, the, cancer, stem, cell, model, asserts, that, within, a, population, of, tumour, cell, there, is, only, a, small, subset, of, cell, that, are, tumourigenic, able, to, form, tumour, these, cell, are, termed, cancer, stem, cell, cscs, and, are, marked, by, the, ability, to, both, and, differentiate, into, progeny, the, csc, model, posit, that, the, heterogeneity, observed, between, tumour, cell, is, the, result, of, difference, in, the, stem, cell, from, which, they, originated, stem, cell, variability, is, often, caused, by, epigenetic, change, but, can, also, result, from, clonal, evolution, of, the, csc, population, where, advantageous, genetic, mutation, can, accumulate, in, cscs, and, their, progeny, see, below, evidence, of, the, cancer, stem, cell, model, ha, been, demonstrated, in, multiple, tumour, type, including, leukemia, glioblastoma, breast, cancer, and, prostate, cancer, however, the, existence, of, cscs, is, still, under, debate, one, reason, for, this, is, that, marker, for, cscs, have, been, difficult, to, reproduce, across, multiple, tumour, further, method, for, determining, tumourigenic, potential, utilize, xenograft, model, these, method, suffer, from, inherent, limitation, such, a, the, need, to, control, immune, response, in, the, transplant, animal, and, the, significant, difference, in, environmental, condition, from, the, primary, tumour, site, to, the, xenograft, site, absence, of, required, exogenous, molecule, or, cofactor, this, ha, caused, some, doubt, about, the, accuracy, of, csc, result, and, the, conclusion, about, which, cell, have, tumourigenic, potential, clonal, evolution, edit, main, article, somatic, evolution, in, cancer, the, clonal, evolution, model, wa, first, proposed, in, by, peter, nowell, in, this, model, tumour, arise, from, a, single, mutated, cell, accumulating, additional, mutation, a, it, progress, these, change, give, rise, to, additional, subpopulation, and, each, of, these, subpopulation, ha, the, ability, to, divide, and, mutate, further, this, heterogeneity, may, give, rise, to, subclones, that, posse, an, evolutionary, advantage, over, the, others, within, the, tumour, environment, and, these, subclones, may, become, dominant, in, the, tumour, over, time, when, proposed, this, model, allowed, for, the, understanding, of, tumour, growth, treatment, failure, and, tumour, aggression, that, occurs, during, the, natural, process, of, tumour, formation, branched, evolution, is, more, likely, to, contribute, to, tumour, heterogeneity, evolution, of, the, initial, tumour, cell, may, occur, by, two, method, linear, expansion, edit, sequentially, ordered, mutation, accumulate, in, driver, gene, tumour, suppressor, gene, and, dna, repair, enzyme, resulting, in, clonal, expansion, of, tumour, cell, linear, expansion, is, le, likely, to, reflect, the, endpoint, of, a, malignant, tumour, because, the, accumulation, of, mutation, is, stochastic, in, heterogeneic, tumour, branched, expansion, edit, expansion, into, multiple, subclonal, population, occurs, through, a, splitting, mechanism, this, method, is, more, associated, with, tumour, heterogeneity, than, linear, expansion, the, acquisition, of, mutation, is, random, a, a, result, of, increased, genomic, instability, with, each, successive, generation, the, mutational, accumulation, may, provide, a, selective, advantage, during, certain, stage, of, tumour, progression, the, tumour, microenvironment, may, also, contribute, to, tumour, expansion, a, it, is, capable, of, altering, the, selective, pressure, that, the, tumour, cell, are, exposed, to, type, cause, of, heterogeneity, edit, multiple, type, of, heterogeneity, have, been, observed, between, tumour, cell, stemming, from, both, genetic, and, variability, genetic, heterogeneity, edit, genetic, heterogeneity, is, a, common, feature, of, tumour, genome, and, can, arise, from, multiple, source, some, cancer, are, initiated, when, exogenous, factor, introduce, mutation, such, a, ultraviolet, radiation, skin, cancer, and, tobacco, lung, cancer, a, more, common, source, is, genomic, instability, which, often, arises, when, key, regulatory, pathway, are, disrupted, in, the, cell, some, example, include, impaired, dna, repair, mechanism, which, can, lead, to, increased, replication, error, and, defect, in, the, mitosis, machinery, that, allow, for, gain, or, loss, of, entire, chromosome, furthermore, it, is, possible, for, genetic, variability, to, be, further, increased, by, some, cancer, therapy, treatment, with, temozolomide, and, other, chemotherapy, drug, other, heterogeneity, edit, tumour, cell, can, also, show, heterogeneity, between, their, expression, profile, this, is, often, caused, by, underlying, epigenetic, change, variation, in, expression, signature, have, been, detected, in, different, region, of, tumour, sample, within, an, individual, researcher, have, shown, that, convergent, mutation, affecting, methyltransferase, and, histone, demethylase, arose, in, spatially, separated, tumour, section, similarly, mtor, a, gene, encoding, a, cell, regulatory, kinase, ha, shown, to, be, constitutively, active, thereby, increasing, phosphorylation, this, active, phosphorylation, may, serve, a, a, biomarker, in, carcinoma, tumour, microenvironment, edit, heterogeneity, between, tumour, cell, can, be, further, increased, due, to, heterogeneity, in, the, tumour, microenvironment, regional, difference, in, the, tumour, availability, of, oxygen, impose, different, selective, pressure, on, tumour, cell, leading, to, a, wider, spectrum, of, dominant, subclones, in, different, spatial, region, of, the, tumour, the, influence, of, microenvironment, on, clonal, dominance, is, also, a, likely, reason, for, the, heterogeneity, between, primary, and, metastatic, tumour, seen, in, many, patient, a, well, a, the, heterogeneity, observed, between, patient, with, the, same, tumour, type, implication, challenge, edit, treatment, resistance, edit, heterogeneic, tumour, may, exhibit, different, sensitivity, to, cytotoxic, drug, among, different, clonal, population, this, is, attributed, to, clonal, interaction, that, may, inhibit, or, alter, therapeutic, efficacy, posing, a, challenge, for, successful, therapy, in, heterogeneic, tumour, and, their, heterogeneic, metastasis, drug, administration, in, heterogeneic, tumour, will, seldom, kill, all, tumour, cell, the, initial, heterogeneic, tumour, population, may, bottleneck, such, that, few, drug, resistant, cell, if, any, will, survive, this, allows, resistant, tumour, population, to, replicate, and, grow, a, new, tumour, through, the, branching, evolution, mechanism, see, above, the, resulting, repopulated, tumour, is, heterogeneic, and, resistant, to, the, initial, drug, therapy, used, the, repopulated, tumour, may, also, return, in, a, more, aggressive, manner, the, administration, of, cytotoxic, drug, often, result, in, initial, tumour, shrinkage, this, represents, the, destruction, of, initial, subclonal, population, within, a, heterogeneic, tumour, leaving, only, resistant, clone, these, resistant, clone, now, contain, a, selective, advantage, and, can, replicate, to, repopulate, the, tumour, replication, will, likely, occur, through, branching, evolution, contributing, to, tumour, heterogeneity, the, repopulated, tumour, may, appear, to, be, more, aggressive, this, is, attributed, to, the, selective, advantage, of, the, tumour, cell, drug, treatment, induces, a, bottleneck, effect, where, resistant, subclones, will, survive, and, propagate, to, a, heterogeneous, tumour, biomarker, discovery, edit, due, to, the, genetic, difference, within, and, between, tumour, biomarkers, that, may, predict, treatment, response, or, prognosis, may, not, be, widely, applicable, however, it, ha, been, suggested, that, the, level, of, heterogeneity, can, itself, be, used, a, a, biomarker, since, more, heterogeneous, tumour, may, be, more, likely, to, contain, subclones, further, research, into, developing, biomarkers, that, account, for, heterogeneity, is, still, in, progress, current, strategy, edit, while, the, problem, of, identifying, characterizing, and, treating, tumour, heterogeneity, is, still, under, active, research, some, effective, strategy, have, been, proposed, including, both, experimental, and, computational, solution, experimental, edit, focused, approach, analyzing, a, specific, genetic, locus, or, set, of, locus, this, may, occur, through, the, detection, of, allelic, imbalance, tumour, dna, is, compared, to, germline, dna, amplification, of, chromosomal, region, fish, sequencing, specific, gene, this, method, is, used, to, trace, the, evolution, of, a, specific, mutation, of, interest, or, to, confirm, a, mutation, researcher, may, suspect, in, a, tumour, advantage, allows, for, the, analysis, of, specific, gene, driver, gene, tumour, suppressor, the, process, is, simple, with, straightforward, interpretation, of, the, result, fish, and, immunofluorescence, allows, focus, on, tumour, cell, subtypes, disadvantage, limited, analysis, will, miss, additional, important, mutation, and, pattern, of, clonal, expansion, allelic, imbalance, may, be, difficult, to, verify, using, microsatellite, marker, therefore, requiring, verification, by, an, independent, technique, fish, fish, requires, large, number, of, cell, and, is, approach, analyzing, the, entire, genome, in, tumour, sample, this, may, be, done, through, karyotyping, or, comparative, genomic, hybridization, cgh, to, detect, chromosomal, abnormality, sequencing, of, tumour, biopsy, is, becoming, more, common, advantage, doe, not, rely, on, prior, knowledge, to, identify, variant, karyotyping, identifies, region, of, large, chromosomal, abnormality, cgh, provides, unbiased, coverage, and, allows, for, allelic, imbalance, to, be, detected, snp, array, sequencing, will, identify, any, variant, that, contribute, to, tumour, heterogeneity, disadvantage, difficult, to, determine, the, functional, impact, of, variant, neutral, or, pathogenic, limited, resolution, karyotyping, of, cultured, cell, may, be, biased, towards, preferential, outgrowth, of, select, tumour, cell, subpopulation, limited, resolution, in, both, method, the, approach, may, generate, large, amount, of, data, and, be, difficult, to, interpret, multiregion, sampling, strategy, generally, requires, multiple, tumour, sample, from, separate, region, of, a, microdissected, tumour, it, is, important, to, avoid, contamination, of, cell, to, ensure, an, accurate, representation, of, gene, expression, and, genetic, composition, seen, within, the, tumour, cell, only, analysis, of, tumour, dna, within, the, spatially, separated, region, allows, for, the, construction, of, a, evolutionary, model, of, tumour, heterogeneity, multiregional, sampling, is, often, used, in, combination, with, the, approach, to, establish, this, heterogeneity, expansion, model, longitudinal, sampling, through, tumour, progression, or, treatment, progression, obtaining, tumour, sample, during, multiple, point, in, time, ha, been, utilized, in, some, case, this, ha, been, suggested, a, a, reliable, method, for, tracking, clonal, evolution, however, this, technique, prof, challenging, in, practice, because, it, requires, periodic, invasive, biopsy, new, research, into, utilizing, circulating, tumour, dna, in, blood, may, provide, a, way, to, identify, biomarkers, throughout, treatment, longitudinal, sampling, used, in, combination, with, the, approach, will, allow, for, the, identification, of, the, accumulated, tumour, cell, mutation, through, time, this, may, in, turn, identify, the, key, driver, mutation, seen, in, initial, tumour, sample, adaptive, therapy, may, be, used, to, prevent, further, tumour, growth, by, adjusting, drug, dose, and, timing, of, drug, administration, based, on, the, tumour, response, this, strategy, is, assumed, to, prevent, resistant, variant, from, dominating, a, tumour, however, more, research, is, required, into, it, applicability, sequencing, edit, pooled, tumour, sequencing, can, be, utilized, where, dna, is, extracted, from, a, mixture, of, tumour, cell, and, analyzed, all, at, once, the, presence, of, heterogeneous, tumour, population, subclones, introduces, additional, challenge, such, a, the, inability, to, detect, mutation, in, rare, subclones, since, these, mutation, will, occur, with, low, frequency, in, the, pooled, sample, they, may, be, indistinguishable, from, background, noise, however, many, variant, caller, are, being, actively, developed, that, are, specifically, designed, for, cancer, data, and, aim, to, identify, rare, variant, present, in, smaller, subclonal, population, these, typically, utilize, matched, normal, dna, a, a, mean, of, distinguishing, true, somatic, variation, from, germline, variation, and, background, sequencing, error, the, inability, to, determine, which, subclones, contain, each, mutation, since, the, data, is, pooled, it, is, not, clear, which, mutation, and, which, population, they, originate, from, new, tool, are, being, developed, that, attempt, to, resolve, clonal, structure, using, allele, frequency, for, the, observed, mutation, sequencing, is, a, new, technique, that, is, valuable, for, assessing, tumour, heterogeneity, because, it, can, characterize, individual, tumour, cell, this, mean, that, the, entire, mutational, profile, of, multiple, distinct, cell, can, be, determined, with, no, ambiguity, while, with, current, technology, it, is, difficult, to, evaluate, sufficiently, large, number, of, single, cell, to, obtain, statistical, power, tumour, data, ha, multiple, advantage, including, the, ability, to, construct, a, phylogenetic, tree, showing, the, evolution, of, tumour, population, using, sequence, or, from, individual, cell, the, evolution, of, the, subclones, can, be, estimated, this, allows, for, the, identification, of, population, that, have, persisted, over, time, and, can, narrow, down, the, list, of, mutation, that, potentially, confer, a, growth, advantage, or, treatment, resistance, on, specific, subclones, section, sequencing, can, be, done, on, multiple, portion, of, a, single, solid, tumour, and, the, variation, in, the, mutation, frequency, across, the, section, can, be, analyzed, to, infer, the, clonal, structure, the, advantage, of, this, approach, over, single, sequencing, include, more, statistical, power, and, availability, of, more, accurate, information, on, the, spatial, positioning, of, sample, the, latter, can, be, used, to, infer, the, frequency, of, clone, in, section, and, provide, insight, on, how, a, tumour, evolves, in, space, in, addition, to, infer, the, clone, genotype, and, phylogenetic, tree, which, model, a, tumour, evolution, in, time, several, computational, method, were, developed, including, clomial, phylosub,
