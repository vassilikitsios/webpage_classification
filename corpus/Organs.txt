dissection, and, staining, advance, in, microscopy, also, had, a, profound, impact, on, biological, thinking, in, the, early, century, a, number, of, biologist, pointed, to, the, central, importance, of, the, cell, then, in, schleiden, and, schwann, began, promoting, the, now, universal, idea, that, the, basic, unit, of, organism, is, the, cell, and, that, individual, cell, have, all, the, characteristic, of, life, although, they, opposed, the, idea, that, all, cell, come, from, the, division, of, other, cell, thanks, to, the, work, of, robert, remak, and, rudolf, virchow, however, by, the, most, biologist, accepted, all, three, tenet, of, what, came, to, be, known, a, cell, theory, meanwhile, taxonomy, and, classification, became, the, focus, of, natural, historian, carl, linnaeus,

show, receptor, for, the, neurotransmitter, gaba, the, shape, and, size, of, the, brain, varies, greatly, in, different, specie, and, identifying, common, feature, is, often, difficult, nevertheless, there, are, a, number, of, principle, of, brain, architecture, that, apply, across, a, wide, range, of, specie, some, aspect, of, brain, structure, are, common, to, almost, the, entire, range, of, animal, specie, others, distinguish, advanced, brain, from, more, primitive, one, or, distinguish, vertebrate, from, invertebrate, the, simplest, way, to, gain, information, about, brain, anatomy, is, by, visual, inspection, but, many, more, sophisticated, technique, have, been, developed, brain, tissue, in, it, natural, state, is, too, soft, to, work, with, but, it, can, be, hardened, by, immersion, in, alcohol, or, other, fixative, and, then, sliced, apart, for, examination, of, the, interior, visually, the, interior, of, the, brain, consists, of, area, of, grey, matter, with, a, dark, color, separated, by, area, of, white, matter, with, a, lighter, color, further, information, can, be, gained, by, staining, slice, of, brain, tissue, with, a, variety, of, chemical, that, bring, out, area, where, specific, type, of, molecule, are, present, in, high, concentration, it, is, also, possible, to, examine, the, microstructure, of, brain, tissue, using, a, microscope, and, to, trace, the, pattern, of, connection, from, one, brain, area, to, another, cellular, structure, neuron, generate, electrical, signal, that, travel, along, their, axon, when, a, pulse, of, electricity, reach, a, junction, called, a, synapse, it, cause, a, neurotransmitter, chemical, to, be, released, which, bind, to, receptor, on, other, cell, and, thereby, alters, their, electrical, activity, the, brain, of, all, specie, are, composed, primarily, of, two, broad, class, of, cell, neuron, and, glial, cell, glial, cell, also, known, a, glia, or, neuroglia, come, in, several, type, and, perform, a, number, of, critical, function, including, structural, support, metabolic, support, insulation, and, guidance, of, development, neuron, however, are, usually, considered, the, most, important, cell, in, the, brain, the, property, that, make, neuron, unique, is, their, ability, to, send, signal, to, specific, target, cell, over, long, distance, they, send, these, signal, by, mean, of, an, axon, which, is, a, thin, protoplasmic, fiber, that, extends, from, the, cell, body, and, project, usually, with, numerous, branch, to, other, area, sometimes, nearby, sometimes, in, distant, part, of, the, brain, or, body, the, length, of, an, axon, can, be, extraordinary, for, example, if, a, pyramidal, cell, an, excitatory, neuron, of, the, cerebral, cortex, were, magnified, so, that, it, cell, body, became, the, size, of, a, human, body, it, axon, equally, magnified, would, become, a, cable, a, few, centimeter, in, diameter, extending, more, than, a, kilometer, these, axon, transmit, signal, in, the, form, of, electrochemical, pulse, called, action, potential, which, last, le, than, a, thousandth, of, a, second, and, travel, along, the, axon, at, speed, of, meter, per, second, some, neuron, emit, action, potential, constantly, at, rate, of, per, second, usually, in, irregular, pattern, other, neuron, are, quiet, most, of, the, time, but, occasionally, emit, a, burst, of, action, potential, axon, transmit, signal, to, other, neuron, by, mean, of, specialized, junction, called, synapsis, a, single, axon, may, make, a, many, a, several, thousand, synaptic, connection, with, other, cell, when, an, action, potential, traveling, along, an, axon, arrives, at, a, synapse, it, cause, a, chemical, called, a, neurotransmitter, to, be, released, the, neurotransmitter, bind, to, receptor, molecule, in, the, membrane, of, the, target, cell, neuron, often, have, extensive, network, of, dendrite, which, receive, synaptic, connection, shown, is, a, pyramidal, neuron, from, the, hippocampus, stained, for, green, fluorescent, protein, synapsis, are, the, key, functional, element, of, the, brain, the, essential, function, of, the, brain, is, communication, and, synapsis, are, the, point, at, which, communication, occurs, the, human, brain, ha, been, estimated, to, contain, approximately, trillion, synapsis, even, the, brain, of, a, fruit, fly, contains, several, million, the, function, of, these, synapsis, are, very, diverse, some, are, excitatory, exciting, the, target, cell, others, are, inhibitory, others, work, by, activating, second, messenger, system, that, change, the, internal, chemistry, of, their, target, cell, in, complex, way, a, large, number, of, synapsis, are, dynamically, modifiable, that, is, they, are, capable, of, changing, strength, in, a, way, that, is, controlled, by, the, pattern, of, signal, that, pas, through, them, it, is, widely, believed, that, modification, of, synapsis, is, the, brain, primary, mechanism, for, learning, and, memory, most, of, the, space, in, the, brain, is, taken, up, by, axon, which, are, often, bundled, together, in, what, are, called, nerve, fiber, tract, a, myelinated, axon, is, wrapped, in, a, fatty, insulating, sheath, of, myelin, which, serf, to, greatly, increase, the, speed, of, signal, propagation, there, are, also, unmyelinated, axon, myelin, is, white, making, part, of, the, brain, filled, exclusively, with, nerve, fiber, appear, a, white, matter, in, contrast, to, the, grey, matter, that, mark, area, with, high, density, of, neuron, cell, body, evolution, main, article, evolution, of, the, brain, generic, bilaterian, nervous, system, nervous, system, of, a, generic, bilaterian, animal, in, the, form, of, a, nerve, cord, with, segmental, enlargement, and, a, brain, at, the, front, except, for, a, few, primitive, organism, such, a, sponge, which, have, no, nervous, system, and, cnidarian, which, have, a, nervous, system, consisting, of, a, diffuse, nerve, net, all, living, multicellular, animal, are, bilaterians, meaning, animal, with, a, bilaterally, symmetric, body, shape, that, is, left, and, right, side, that, are, approximate, mirror, image, of, each, other, all, bilaterians, are, thought, to, have, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, that, appeared, early, in, the, cambrian, period, million, year, ago, and, it, ha, been, hypothesized, that, this, common, ancestor, had, the, shape, of, a, simple, tubeworm, with, a, segmented, body, at, a, schematic, level, that, basic, continues, to, be, reflected, in, the, body, and, nervous, system, architecture, of, all, modern, bilaterians, including, vertebrate, the, fundamental, bilateral, body, form, is, a, tube, with, a, hollow, gut, cavity, running, from, the, mouth, to, the, anus, and, a, nerve, cord, with, an, enlargement, a, ganglion, for, each, body, segment, with, an, especially, large, ganglion, at, the, front, called, the, brain, the, brain, is, small, and, simple, in, some, specie, such, a, nematode, worm, in, other, specie, including, vertebrate, it, is, the, most, complex, organ, in, the, body, some, type, of, worm, such, a, leech, also, have, an, enlarged, ganglion, at, the, back, end, of, the, nerve, cord, known, a, a, tail, brain, there, are, a, few, type, of, existing, bilaterians, that, lack, a, recognizable, brain, including, echinoderm, tunicate, and, acoelomorphs, a, group, of, primitive, flatworm, it, ha, not, been, definitively, established, whether, the, existence, of, these, brainless, specie, indicates, that, the, earliest, bilaterians, lacked, a, brain, or, whether, their, ancestor, evolved, in, a, way, that, led, to, the, disappearance, of, a, previously, existing, brain, structure, invertebrate, fruit, fly, drosophila, have, been, extensively, studied, to, gain, insight, into, the, role, of, gene, in, brain, development, this, category, includes, arthropod, mollusc, and, numerous, type, of, worm, the, diversity, of, invertebrate, body, plan, is, matched, by, an, equal, diversity, in, brain, structure, two, group, of, invertebrate, have, notably, complex, brain, arthropod, insect, crustacean, arachnid, and, others, and, cephalopod, octopus, squid, and, similar, mollusc, the, brain, of, arthropod, and, cephalopod, arise, from, twin, parallel, nerve, cord, that, extend, through, the, body, of, the, animal, arthropod, have, a, central, brain, with, three, division, and, large, optical, lobe, behind, each, eye, for, visual, processing, cephalopod, such, a, the, octopus, and, squid, have, the, largest, brain, of, any, invertebrate, there, are, several, invertebrate, specie, whose, brain, have, been, studied, intensively, because, they, have, property, that, make, them, convenient, for, experimental, work, fruit, fly, drosophila, because, of, the, large, array, of, technique, available, for, studying, their, genetics, have, been, a, natural, subject, for, studying, the, role, of, gene, in, brain, development, in, spite, of, the, large, evolutionary, distance, between, insect, and, mammal, many, aspect, of, drosophila, neurogenetics, have, been, shown, to, be, relevant, to, human, the, first, biological, clock, gene, for, example, were, identified, by, examining, drosophila, mutant, that, showed, disrupted, daily, activity, cycle, a, search, in, the, genome, of, vertebrate, revealed, a, set, of, analogous, gene, which, were, found, to, play, similar, role, in, the, mouse, biological, therefore, almost, certainly, in, the, human, biological, clock, a, well, study, done, on, drosophila, also, show, that, most, neuropil, region, of, the, brain, are, continuously, reorganized, throughout, life, in, response, to, specific, living, condition, the, nematode, worm, caenorhabditis, elegans, like, drosophila, ha, been, studied, largely, because, of, it, importance, in, genetics, in, the, early, sydney, brenner, chose, it, a, a, model, organism, for, studying, the, way, that, gene, control, development, one, of, the, advantage, of, working, with, this, worm, is, that, the, body, plan, is, very, stereotyped, the, nervous, system, of, the, hermaphrodite, contains, exactly, neuron, always, in, the, same, place, making, identical, synaptic, connection, in, every, worm, brenner, team, sliced, worm, into, thousand, of, ultrathin, section, and, photographed, each, one, under, an, electron, microscope, then, visually, matched, fiber, from, section, to, section, to, map, out, every, neuron, and, synapse, in, the, entire, body, the, complete, neuronal, wiring, diagram, of, it, connectome, wa, achieved, nothing, approaching, this, level, of, detail, is, available, for, any, other, organism, and, the, information, gained, ha, enabled, a, multitude, of, study, that, would, otherwise, have, not, been, possible, the, sea, slug, aplysia, californica, wa, chosen, by, nobel, neurophysiologist, eric, kandel, a, a, model, for, studying, the, cellular, basis, of, learning, and, memory, because, of, the, simplicity, and, accessibility, of, it, nervous, system, and, it, ha, been, examined, in, hundred, of, experiment, vertebrate, the, brain, of, a, shark, the, first, vertebrate, appeared, over, million, year, ago, mya, during, the, cambrian, period, and, may, have, resembled, the, modern, hagfish, in, form, shark, appeared, about, mya, amphibian, about, mya, reptile, about, mya, and, mammal, about, mya, each, specie, ha, an, equally, long, evolutionary, history, but, the, brain, of, modern, hagfish, lamprey, shark, amphibian, reptile, and, mammal, show, a, gradient, of, size, and, complexity, that, roughly, follows, the, evolutionary, sequence, all, of, these, brain, contain, the, same, set, of, basic, anatomical, component, but, many, are, rudimentary, in, the, hagfish, whereas, in, mammal, the, foremost, part, the, telencephalon, is, greatly, elaborated, and, expanded, brain, are, most, simply, compared, in, term, of, their, size, the, relationship, between, brain, size, body, size, and, other, variable, ha, been, studied, across, a, wide, range, of, vertebrate, specie, a, a, rule, brain, size, increase, with, body, size, but, not, in, a, simple, linear, proportion, in, general, smaller, animal, tend, to, have, larger, brain, measured, a, a, fraction, of, body, size, for, mammal, the, relationship, between, brain, volume, and, body, mass, essentially, follows, a, power, law, with, an, exponent, of, about, this, formula, describes, the, central, tendency, but, every, family, of, mammal, departs, from, it, to, some, degree, in, a, way, that, reflects, in, part, the, complexity, of, their, behavior, for, example, primate, have, brain, to, time, larger, than, the, formula, predicts, predator, tend, to, have, larger, brain, than, their, prey, relative, to, body, size, the, main, subdivision, of, the, embryonic, vertebrate, brain, which, later, differentiate, into, the, forebrain, midbrain, and, hindbrain, all, vertebrate, brain, share, a, common, underlying, form, which, appears, most, clearly, during, early, stage, of, embryonic, development, in, it, earliest, form, the, brain, appears, a, three, swelling, at, the, front, end, of, the, neural, tube, these, swelling, eventually, become, the, forebrain, midbrain, and, hindbrain, the, prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and, rhombencephalon, respectively, at, the, earliest, stage, of, brain, development, the, three, area, are, roughly, equal, in, size, in, many, class, of, vertebrate, such, a, fish, and, amphibian, the, three, part, remain, similar, in, size, in, the, adult, but, in, mammal, the, forebrain, becomes, much, larger, than, the, other, part, and, the, midbrain, becomes, very, small, the, brain, of, vertebrate, are, made, of, very, soft, tissue, living, brain, tissue, is, pinkish, on, the, outside, and, mostly, white, on, the, inside, with, subtle, variation, in, color, vertebrate, brain, are, surrounded, by, a, system, of, connective, tissue, membrane, called, meninges, that, separate, the, skull, from, the, brain, blood, vessel, enter, the, central, nervous, system, through, hole, in, the, meningeal, layer, the, cell, in, the, blood, vessel, wall, are, joined, tightly, to, one, another, forming, the, barrier, which, block, the, passage, of, many, toxin, and, pathogen, though, at, the, same, time, blocking, antibody, and, some, drug, thereby, presenting, special, challenge, in, treatment, of, disease, of, the, brain, neuroanatomists, usually, divide, the, vertebrate, brain, into, six, main, region, the, telencephalon, cerebral, hemisphere, diencephalon, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, mesencephalon, midbrain, cerebellum, pons, and, medulla, oblongata, each, of, these, area, ha, a, complex, internal, structure, some, part, such, a, the, cerebral, cortex, and, the, cerebellar, cortex, consist, of, layer, that, are, folded, or, convoluted, to, fit, within, the, available, space, other, part, such, a, the, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, consist, of, cluster, of, many, small, nucleus, thousand, of, distinguishable, area, can, be, identified, within, the, vertebrate, brain, based, on, fine, distinction, of, neural, structure, chemistry, and, connectivity, although, the, same, basic, component, are, present, in, all, vertebrate, brain, some, branch, of, vertebrate, evolution, have, led, to, substantial, distortion, of, brain, geometry, especially, in, the, forebrain, area, the, brain, of, a, shark, show, the, basic, component, in, a, straightforward, way, but, in, teleost, fish, the, great, majority, of, existing, fish, specie, the, forebrain, ha, become, everted, like, a, sock, turned, inside, out, in, bird, there, are, also, major, change, in, forebrain, structure, these, distortion, can, make, it, difficult, to, match, brain, component, from, one, specie, with, those, of, another, specie, the, main, anatomical, region, of, the, vertebrate, brain, shown, for, shark, and, human, the, same, part, are, present, but, they, differ, greatly, in, size, and, shape, here, is, a, list, of, some, of, the, most, important, vertebrate, brain, component, along, with, a, brief, description, of, their, function, a, currently, understood, the, medulla, along, with, the, spinal, cord, contains, many, small, nucleus, involved, in, a, wide, variety, of, sensory, and, involuntary, motor, function, such, a, vomiting, heart, rate, and, digestive, process, the, pons, lie, in, the, brainstem, directly, above, the, medulla, among, other, thing, it, contains, nucleus, that, control, often, voluntary, but, simple, act, such, a, sleep, respiration, swallowing, bladder, function, equilibrium, eye, movement, facial, expression, and, posture, the, hypothalamus, is, a, small, region, at, the, base, of, the, forebrain, whose, complexity, and, importance, belies, it, size, it, is, composed, of, numerous, small, nucleus, each, with, distinct, connection, and, neurochemistry, the, hypothalamus, is, engaged, in, additional, involuntary, or, partially, voluntary, act, such, a, sleep, and, wake, cycle, eating, and, drinking, and, the, release, of, some, hormone, the, thalamus, is, a, collection, of, nucleus, with, diverse, function, some, are, involved, in, relaying, information, to, and, from, the, cerebral, hemisphere, while, others, are, involved, in, motivation, the, subthalamic, area, zona, incerta, seems, to, contain, system, for, several, type, of, consummatory, behavior, such, a, eating, drinking, defecation, and, copulation, the, cerebellum, modulates, the, output, of, other, brain, system, whether, motor, related, or, thought, related, to, make, them, certain, and, precise, removal, of, the, cerebellum, doe, not, prevent, an, animal, from, doing, anything, in, particular, but, it, make, action, hesitant, and, clumsy, this, precision, is, not, but, learned, by, trial, and, error, the, muscle, coordination, learned, while, riding, a, bicycle, is, an, example, of, a, type, of, neural, plasticity, that, may, take, place, largely, within, the, cerebellum, of, the, brain, total, volume, consists, of, the, cerebellum, and, of, all, neuron, are, held, within, it, structure, the, optic, tectum, allows, action, to, be, directed, toward, point, in, space, most, commonly, in, response, to, visual, input, in, mammal, it, is, usually, referred, to, a, the, superior, colliculus, and, it, function, is, to, direct, eye, movement, it, also, directs, reaching, movement, and, other, action, it, receives, strong, visual, input, but, also, input, from, other, sens, that, are, useful, in, directing, action, such, a, auditory, input, in, owl, and, input, from, the, thermosensitive, pit, organ, in, snake, in, some, primitive, fish, such, a, lamprey, this, region, is, the, largest, part, of, the, brain, the, superior, colliculus, is, part, of, the, midbrain, the, pallium, is, a, layer, of, gray, matter, that, lie, on, the, surface, of, the, forebrain, and, is, the, most, complex, and, most, recent, evolutionary, development, of, the, brain, a, an, organ, in, reptile, and, mammal, it, is, called, the, cerebral, cortex, multiple, function, involve, the, pallium, including, smell, and, spatial, memory, in, mammal, where, it, becomes, so, large, a, to, dominate, the, brain, it, take, over, function, from, many, other, brain, area, in, many, mammal, the, cerebral, cortex, consists, of, folded, bulge, called, gyrus, that, create, deep, furrow, or, fissure, called, sulcus, the, fold, increase, the, surface, area, of, the, cortex, and, therefore, increase, the, amount, of, gray, matter, and, the, amount, of, information, that, can, be, stored, and, processed, the, hippocampus, strictly, speaking, is, found, only, in, mammal, however, the, area, it, derives, from, the, medial, pallium, ha, counterpart, in, all, vertebrate, there, is, evidence, that, this, part, of, the, brain, is, involved, in, complex, event, such, a, spatial, memory, and, navigation, in, fish, bird, reptile, and, mammal, the, basal, ganglion, are, a, group, of, interconnected, structure, in, the, forebrain, the, primary, function, of, the, basal, ganglion, appears, to, be, action, selection, they, send, inhibitory, signal, to, all, part, of, the, brain, that, can, generate, motor, behavior, and, in, the, right, circumstance, can, release, the, inhibition, so, that, the, system, are, able, to, execute, their, action, reward, and, punishment, exert, their, most, important, neural, effect, by, altering, connection, within, the, basal, ganglion, the, olfactory, bulb, is, a, special, structure, that, process, olfactory, sensory, signal, and, sends, it, output, to, the, olfactory, part, of, the, pallium, it, is, a, major, brain, component, in, many, vertebrate, but, is, greatly, reduced, in, human, and, other, primate, whose, sens, are, dominated, by, information, acquired, by, sight, rather, than, smell, mammal, the, most, obvious, difference, between, the, brain, of, mammal, and, other, vertebrate, is, in, term, of, size, on, average, a, mammal, ha, a, brain, roughly, twice, a, large, a, that, of, a, bird, of, the, same, body, size, and, ten, time, a, large, a, that, of, a, reptile, of, the, same, body, size, size, however, is, not, the, only, difference, there, are, also, substantial, difference, in, shape, the, hindbrain, and, midbrain, of, mammal, are, generally, similar, to, those, of, other, vertebrate, but, dramatic, difference, appear, in, the, forebrain, which, is, greatly, enlarged, and, also, altered, in, structure, the, cerebral, cortex, is, the, part, of, the, brain, that, most, strongly, distinguishes, mammal, in, vertebrate, the, surface, of, the, cerebrum, is, lined, with, a, comparatively, simple, structure, called, the, pallium, in, mammal, the, pallium, evolves, into, a, complex, structure, called, neocortex, or, isocortex, several, area, at, the, edge, of, the, neocortex, including, the, hippocampus, and, amygdala, are, also, much, more, extensively, developed, in, mammal, than, in, other, vertebrate, the, elaboration, of, the, cerebral, cortex, carry, with, it, change, to, other, brain, area, the, superior, colliculus, which, play, a, major, role, in, visual, control, of, behavior, in, most, vertebrate, shrink, to, a, small, size, in, mammal, and, many, of, it, function, are, taken, over, by, visual, area, of, the, cerebral, cortex, the, cerebellum, of, mammal, contains, a, large, portion, the, neocerebellum, dedicated, to, supporting, the, cerebral, cortex, which, ha, no, counterpart, in, other, vertebrate, primate, encephalization, quotient, specie, eq, human, chimpanzee, rhesus, monkey, bottlenose, dolphin, elephant, dog, horse, rat, see, also, human, brain, the, brain, of, human, and, other, primate, contain, the, same, structure, a, the, brain, of, other, mammal, but, are, generally, larger, in, proportion, to, body, size, the, most, widely, accepted, way, of, comparing, brain, size, across, specie, is, the, encephalization, quotient, eq, which, take, into, account, the, nonlinearity, of, the, relationship, human, have, an, average, eq, in, the, range, while, most, other, primate, have, an, eq, in, the, range, dolphin, have, value, higher, than, those, of, primate, other, than, human, but, nearly, all, other, mammal, have, eq, value, that, are, substantially, lower, most, of, the, enlargement, of, the, primate, brain, come, from, a, massive, expansion, of, the, cerebral, cortex, especially, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, the, part, of, the, cortex, involved, in, vision, the, visual, processing, network, of, primate, includes, at, least, distinguishable, brain, area, with, a, complex, web, of, interconnection, it, ha, been, estimated, that, visual, processing, area, occupy, more, than, half, of, the, total, surface, of, the, primate, neocortex, the, prefrontal, cortex, carry, out, function, that, include, planning, working, memory, motivation, attention, and, executive, control, it, take, up, a, much, larger, proportion, of, the, brain, for, primate, than, for, other, specie, and, an, especially, large, fraction, of, the, human, brain, physiology, the, function, of, the, brain, depend, on, the, ability, of, neuron, to, transmit, electrochemical, signal, to, other, cell, and, their, ability, to, respond, appropriately, to, electrochemical, signal, received, from, other, cell, the, electrical, property, of, neuron, are, controlled, by, a, wide, variety, of, biochemical, and, metabolic, process, most, notably, the, interaction, between, neurotransmitter, and, receptor, that, take, place, at, synapsis, neurotransmitter, and, receptor, neurotransmitter, are, chemical, that, are, released, at, synapsis, when, an, action, potential, activates, attach, themselves, to, receptor, molecule, on, the, membrane, of, the, synapse, target, cell, and, thereby, alter, the, electrical, or, chemical, property, of, the, receptor, molecule, with, few, exception, each, neuron, in, the, brain, release, the, same, chemical, neurotransmitter, or, combination, of, neurotransmitter, at, all, the, synaptic, connection, it, make, with, other, neuron, this, rule, is, known, a, dale, principle, thus, a, neuron, can, be, characterized, by, the, neurotransmitter, that, it, release, the, great, majority, of, psychoactive, drug, exert, their, effect, by, altering, specific, neurotransmitter, system, this, applies, to, drug, such, a, cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and, many, others, the, two, neurotransmitter, that, are, used, most, widely, in, the, vertebrate, brain, are, glutamate, which, almost, always, exerts, excitatory, effect, on, target, neuron, and, acid, gaba, which, is, almost, always, inhibitory, neuron, using, these, transmitter, can, be, found, in, nearly, every, part, of, the, brain, because, of, their, ubiquity, drug, that, act, on, glutamate, or, gaba, tend, to, have, broad, and, powerful, effect, some, general, anesthetic, act, by, reducing, the, effect, of, glutamate, most, tranquilizer, exert, their, sedative, effect, by, enhancing, the, effect, of, gaba, there, are, dozen, of, other, chemical, neurotransmitter, that, are, used, in, more, limited, area, of, the, brain, often, area, dedicated, to, a, particular, function, serotonin, for, primary, target, of, antidepressant, drug, and, many, dietary, exclusively, from, a, small, brainstem, area, called, the, raphe, nucleus, norepinephrine, which, is, involved, in, arousal, come, exclusively, from, a, nearby, small, area, called, the, locus, coeruleus, other, neurotransmitter, such, a, acetylcholine, and, dopamine, have, multiple, source, in, the, brain, but, are, not, a, ubiquitously, distributed, a, glutamate, and, gaba, electrical, activity, brain, electrical, activity, recorded, from, a, human, patient, during, an, epileptic, seizure, a, a, side, effect, of, the, electrochemical, process, used, by, neuron, for, signaling, brain, tissue, generates, electric, field, when, it, is, active, when, large, number, of, neuron, show, synchronized, activity, the, electric, field, that, they, generate, can, be, large, enough, to, detect, outside, the, skull, using, electroencephalography, eeg, or, magnetoencephalography, meg, eeg, recording, along, with, recording, made, from, electrode, implanted, inside, the, brain, of, animal, such, a, rat, show, that, the, brain, of, a, living, animal, is, constantly, active, even, during, sleep, each, part, of, the, brain, show, a, mixture, of, rhythmic, and, nonrhythmic, activity, which, may, vary, according, to, behavioral, state, in, mammal, the, cerebral, cortex, tends, to, show, large, slow, delta, wave, during, sleep, faster, alpha, wave, when, the, animal, is, awake, but, inattentive, and, irregular, activity, when, the, animal, is, actively, engaged, in, a, task, during, an, epileptic, seizure, the, brain, inhibitory, control, mechanism, fail, to, function, and, electrical, activity, rise, to, pathological, level, producing, eeg, trace, that, show, large, wave, and, spike, pattern, not, seen, in, a, healthy, brain, relating, these, pattern, to, the, computational, function, of, individual, neuron, is, a, major, focus, of, current, research, in, neurophysiology, metabolism, all, vertebrate, have, a, barrier, that, allows, metabolism, inside, the, brain, to, operate, differently, from, metabolism, in, other, part, of, the, body, glial, cell, play, a, major, role, in, brain, metabolism, by, controlling, the, chemical, composition, of, the, fluid, that, surround, neuron, including, level, of, ion, and, nutrient, brain, tissue, consumes, a, large, amount, of, energy, in, proportion, to, it, volume, so, large, brain, place, severe, metabolic, demand, on, animal, the, need, to, limit, body, weight, in, order, for, example, to, fly, ha, apparently, led, to, selection, for, a, reduction, of, brain, size, in, some, specie, such, a, bat, most, of, the, brain, energy, consumption, go, into, sustaining, the, electric, charge, membrane, potential, of, neuron, most, vertebrate, specie, devote, between, and, of, basal, metabolism, to, the, brain, in, primate, however, the, percentage, is, much, human, it, rise, to, the, energy, consumption, of, the, brain, doe, not, vary, greatly, over, time, but, active, region, of, the, cerebral, cortex, consume, somewhat, more, energy, than, inactive, region, this, form, the, basis, for, the, functional, brain, imaging, method, pet, fmri, and, nirs, the, brain, typically, get, most, of, it, energy, from, metabolism, of, glucose, blood, sugar, but, ketone, provide, a, major, alternative, source, together, with, contribution, from, medium, chain, fatty, acid, caprylic, and, heptanoic, acid, lactate, acetate, and, possibly, amino, acid, function, further, information, dualism, philosophy, of, mind, from, an, perspective, the, function, of, the, brain, is, to, provide, coherent, control, over, the, action, of, an, animal, a, centralized, brain, allows, group, of, muscle, to, be, in, complex, pattern, it, also, allows, stimulus, impinging, on, one, part, of, the, body, to, evoke, response, in, other, part, and, it, can, prevent, different, part, of, the, body, from, acting, at, to, each, other, to, generate, purposeful, and, unified, action, the, brain, first, brings, information, from, sense, organ, together, at, a, central, location, it, then, process, this, raw, data, to, extract, information, about, the, structure, of, the, environment, next, it, combine, the, processed, sensory, information, with, information, about, the, current, need, of, an, animal, and, with, memory, of, past, circumstance, finally, on, the, basis, of, the, result, it, generates, motor, response, pattern, that, are, suited, to, maximize, the, welfare, of, the, animal, these, task, require, intricate, interplay, between, a, variety, of, functional, subsystem, information, processing, the, invention, of, electronic, computer, in, the, along, with, the, development, of, mathematical, information, theory, led, to, a, realization, that, brain, can, potentially, be, understood, a, information, processing, system, this, concept, formed, the, basis, of, the, field, of, cybernetics, and, eventually, gave, rise, to, the, field, now, known, a, computational, neuroscience, the, earliest, attempt, at, cybernetics, were, somewhat, crude, in, that, they, treated, the, brain, a, essentially, a, digital, computer, in, disguise, a, for, example, in, john, von, neumann, book, the, computer, and, the, brain, over, the, year, though, accumulating, information, about, the, electrical, response, of, brain, cell, recorded, from, behaving, animal, ha, steadily, moved, theoretical, concept, in, the, direction, of, increasing, realism, model, of, a, neural, circuit, in, the, cerebellum, a, proposed, by, james, albus, the, essence, of, the, information, processing, approach, is, to, try, to, understand, brain, function, in, term, of, information, flow, and, implementation, of, algorithm, one, of, the, most, influential, early, contribution, wa, a, paper, titled, what, the, frog, eye, tell, the, frog, brain, the, paper, examined, the, visual, response, of, neuron, in, the, retina, and, optic, tectum, of, frog, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, some, neuron, in, the, tectum, of, the, frog, are, wired, to, combine, elementary, response, in, a, way, that, make, them, function, a, bug, perceiver, a, few, year, later, david, hubel, and, torsten, wiesel, discovered, cell, in, the, primary, visual, cortex, of, monkey, that, become, active, when, sharp, edge, move, across, specific, point, in, the, field, of, discovery, for, which, they, won, a, nobel, prize, study, in, visual, area, found, cell, that, detect, binocular, disparity, color, movement, and, aspect, of, shape, with, area, located, at, increasing, distance, from, the, primary, visual, cortex, showing, increasingly, complex, response, other, investigation, of, brain, area, unrelated, to, vision, have, revealed, cell, with, a, wide, variety, of, response, correlate, some, related, to, memory, some, to, abstract, type, of, cognition, such, a, space, theorist, have, worked, to, understand, these, response, pattern, by, constructing, mathematical, model, of, neuron, and, neural, network, which, can, be, simulated, using, computer, some, useful, model, are, abstract, focusing, on, the, conceptual, structure, of, neural, algorithm, rather, than, the, detail, of, how, they, are, implemented, in, the, brain, other, model, attempt, to, incorporate, data, about, the, biophysical, property, of, real, neuron, no, model, on, any, level, is, yet, considered, to, be, a, fully, valid, description, of, brain, function, though, the, essential, difficulty, is, that, sophisticated, computation, by, neural, network, requires, distributed, processing, in, which, hundred, or, thousand, of, neuron, work, method, of, brain, activity, recording, are, only, capable, of, isolating, action, potential, from, a, few, dozen, neuron, at, a, time, furthermore, even, single, neuron, appear, to, be, complex, and, capable, of, performing, computation, so, brain, model, that, do, reflect, this, are, arguably, too, abstractive, to, be, representative, of, brain, operation, model, that, do, try, to, capture, this, are, very, computationally, expensive, and, arguably, intractable, with, present, computational, resource, however, having, said, this, the, human, brain, project, is, trying, to, build, a, realistic, detailed, computational, model, of, the, entire, human, brain, it, remains, to, be, seen, what, level, of, success, they, can, achieve, in, the, time, frame, of, the, project, and, the, wisdom, of, it, ha, been, publically, contested, with, scientist, on, both, side, of, the, argument, perception, diagram, of, signal, processing, in, the, auditory, system, one, of, the, primary, function, of, a, brain, is, to, extract, biologically, relevant, information, from, sensory, input, the, human, brain, is, provided, with, information, about, light, sound, the, chemical, composition, of, the, atmosphere, temperature, head, orientation, limb, position, the, chemical, composition, of, the, bloodstream, and, more, in, other, animal, additional, sens, may, be, present, such, a, the, infrared, of, snake, the, magnetic, field, sense, of, some, bird, or, the, electric, field, sense, of, some, type, of, fish, moreover, other, animal, may, develop, existing, sensory, system, in, new, way, such, a, the, adaptation, by, bat, of, the, auditory, sense, into, a, form, of, sonar, one, way, or, another, all, of, these, sensory, modality, are, initially, detected, by, specialized, sensor, that, project, signal, into, the, brain, each, sensory, system, begin, with, specialized, receptor, cell, such, a, neuron, in, the, retina, of, the, eye, neuron, in, the, cochlea, of, the, ear, or, neuron, in, the, skin, the, axon, of, sensory, receptor, cell, travel, into, the, spinal, cord, or, brain, where, they, transmit, their, signal, to, a, sensory, nucleus, dedicated, to, one, specific, sensory, modality, this, primary, sensory, nucleus, sends, information, to, sensory, area, that, are, dedicated, to, the, same, modality, eventually, via, a, in, the, thalamus, the, signal, are, sent, to, the, cerebral, cortex, where, they, are, processed, to, extract, biologically, relevant, feature, and, integrated, with, signal, coming, from, other, sensory, system, motor, control, motor, system, are, area, of, the, brain, that, are, directly, or, indirectly, involved, in, producing, body, movement, that, is, in, activating, muscle, except, for, the, muscle, that, control, the, eye, which, are, driven, by, nucleus, in, the, midbrain, all, the, voluntary, muscle, in, the, body, are, directly, innervated, by, motor, neuron, in, the, spinal, cord, and, hindbrain, spinal, motor, neuron, are, controlled, both, by, neural, circuit, intrinsic, to, the, spinal, cord, and, by, input, that, descend, from, the, brain, the, intrinsic, spinal, circuit, implement, many, reflex, response, and, contain, pattern, generator, for, rhythmic, movement, such, a, walking, or, swimming, the, descending, connection, from, the, brain, allow, for, more, sophisticated, control, the, brain, contains, several, motor, area, that, project, directly, to, the, spinal, cord, at, the, lowest, level, are, motor, area, in, the, medulla, and, pons, which, control, stereotyped, movement, such, a, walking, breathing, or, swallowing, at, a, higher, level, are, area, in, the, midbrain, such, a, the, red, nucleus, which, is, responsible, for, coordinating, movement, of, the, arm, and, leg, at, a, higher, level, yet, is, the, primary, motor, cortex, a, strip, of, tissue, located, at, the, posterior, edge, of, the, frontal, lobe, the, primary, motor, cortex, sends, projection, to, the, subcortical, motor, area, but, also, sends, a, massive, projection, directly, to, the, spinal, cord, through, the, pyramidal, tract, this, direct, corticospinal, projection, allows, for, precise, voluntary, control, of, the, fine, detail, of, movement, other, brain, area, exert, secondary, effect, by, projecting, to, the, primary, motor, area, among, the, most, important, secondary, area, are, the, premotor, cortex, basal, ganglion, and, cerebellum, major, area, involved, in, controlling, movement, area, location, function, ventral, horn, spinal, cord, contains, motor, neuron, that, directly, activate, muscle, oculomotor, nucleus, midbrain, contains, motor, neuron, that, directly, activate, the, eye, muscle, cerebellum, hindbrain, calibrates, precision, and, timing, of, movement, basal, ganglion, forebrain, action, selection, on, the, basis, of, motivation, motor, cortex,

lobe, sequence, movement, into, temporal, pattern, prefrontal, cortex, frontal, lobe, planning, and, other, executive, function, in, addition, to, all, of, the, above, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, contain, extensive, circuitry, to, control, the, autonomic, nervous, system, which, work, by, secreting, hormone, and, by, modulating, the, smooth, muscle, of, the, gut, the, autonomic, nervous, system, affect, heart, rate, digestion, respiration, rate, salivation, perspiration, urination, and, sexual, arousal, and, several, other, process, most, of, it, function, are, not, under, direct, voluntary, control, arousal, see, also, sleep, perhaps, the, most, obvious, aspect, of, the, behavior, of, any, animal, is, the, daily, cycle, between, sleeping, and, waking, arousal, and, alertness, are, also, modulated, on, a, finer, time, scale, though, by, an, extensive, network, of, brain, area, a, key, component, of, the, arousal, system, is, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, scn, a, tiny, part, of, the, hypothalamus, located, directly, above, the, point, at, which, the, optic, nerve, from, the, two, eye, cross, the, scn, contains, the, body, central, biological, clock, neuron, there, show, activity, level, that, rise, and, fall, with, a, period, of, about, hour, circadian, rhythm, these, activity, fluctuation, are, driven, by, rhythmic, change, in, expression, of, a, set, of, clock, gene, the, scn, continues, to, keep, time, even, if, it, is, excised, from, the, brain, and, placed, in, a, dish, of, warm, nutrient, solution, but, it, ordinarily, receives, input, from, the, optic, nerve, through, the, retinohypothalamic, tract, rht, that, allows, daily, cycle, to, calibrate, the, clock, the, scn, project, to, a, set, of, area, in, the, hypothalamus, brainstem, and, midbrain, that, are, involved, in, implementing, cycle, an, important, component, of, the, system, is, the, reticular, formation, a, group, of, scattered, diffusely, through, the, core, of, the, lower, brain, reticular, neuron, send, signal, to, the, thalamus, which, in, turn, sends, signal, to, every, part, of, the, cortex, damage, to, the, reticular, formation, can, produce, a, permanent, state, of, coma, sleep, involves, great, change, in, brain, activity, until, the, it, wa, generally, believed, that, the, brain, essentially, shuts, off, during, sleep, but, this, is, now, known, to, be, far, from, true, activity, continues, but, pattern, become, very, different, there, are, two, type, of, sleep, rem, sleep, with, dreaming, and, nrem, usually, without, dreaming, sleep, which, repeat, in, slightly, varying, pattern, throughout, a, sleep, episode, three, broad, type, of, distinct, brain, activity, pattern, can, be, measured, rem, light, nrem, and, deep, nrem, during, deep, nrem, sleep, also, called, slow, wave, sleep, activity, in, the, cortex, take, the, form, of, large, synchronized, wave, whereas, in, the, waking, state, it, is, noisy, and, desynchronized, level, of, the, neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, and, serotonin, drop, during, slow, wave, sleep, and, fall, almost, to, zero, during, rem, sleep, level, of, acetylcholine, show, the, reverse, pattern, homeostasis, of, a, human, head, showing, location, of, the, hypothalamus, for, any, animal, survival, requires, maintaining, a, variety, of, parameter, of, bodily, state, within, a, limited, range, of, variation, these, include, temperature, water, content, salt, concentration, in, the, bloodstream, blood, glucose, level, blood, oxygen, level, and, others, the, ability, of, an, animal, to, regulate, the, internal, environment, of, it, milieu, a, pioneering, physiologist, claude, bernard, called, known, a, homeostasis, greek, for, standing, still, maintaining, homeostasis, is, a, crucial, function, of, the, brain, the, basic, principle, that, underlies, homeostasis, is, negative, feedback, any, time, a, parameter, diverges, from, it, sensor, generate, an, error, signal, that, evokes, a, response, that, cause, the, parameter, to, shift, back, toward, it, optimum, value, this, principle, is, widely, used, in, engineering, for, example, in, the, control, of, temperature, using, a, thermostat, in, vertebrate, the, part, of, the, brain, that, play, the, greatest, role, is, the, hypothalamus, a, small, region, at, the, base, of, the, forebrain, whose, size, doe, not, reflect, it, complexity, or, the, importance, of, it, function, the, hypothalamus, is, a, collection, of, small, nucleus, most, of, which, are, involved, in, basic, biological, function, some, of, these, function, relate, to, arousal, or, to, social, interaction, such, a, sexuality, aggression, or, maternal, behavior, but, many, of, them, relate, to, homeostasis, several, hypothalamic, nucleus, receive, input, from, sensor, located, in, the, lining, of, blood, vessel, conveying, information, about, temperature, sodium, level, glucose, level, blood, oxygen, level, and, other, parameter, these, hypothalamic, nucleus, send, output, signal, to, motor, area, that, can, generate, action, to, rectify, deficiency, some, of, the, output, also, go, to, the, pituitary, gland, a, tiny, gland, attached, to, the, brain, directly, underneath, the, hypothalamus, the, pituitary, gland, secretes, hormone, into, the, bloodstream, where, they, circulate, throughout, the, body, and, induce, change, in, cellular, activity, motivation, component, of, the, basal, ganglion, shown, in, two, of, the, human, brain, blue, caudate, nucleus, and, putamen, green, globus, pallidus, red, subthalamic, nucleus, black, substantia, nigra, according, to, evolutionary, theory, individual, are, genetically, programmed, to, behave, in, way, that, ensure, survival, and, reproductive, success, this, overarching, goal, of, genetic, fitness, translates, into, a, set, of, specific, behavior, such, a, seeking, food, water, shelter, and, a, mate, the, motivational, system, in, the, brain, monitor, the, current, state, of, satisfaction, of, these, goal, and, activates, behavior, to, meet, any, need, that, arise, the, motivational, system, work, largely, by, a, mechanism, when, a, particular, behavior, is, followed, by, favorable, consequence, the, reward, mechanism, in, the, brain, is, activated, which, induces, structural, change, inside, the, brain, that, cause, the, same, behavior, to, be, repeated, later, whenever, a, similar, situation, arises, conversely, when, a, behavior, is, followed, by, unfavorable, consequence, the, brain, punishment, mechanism, is, activated, inducing, structural, change, that, cause, the, behavior, to, be, suppressed, when, similar, situation, arise, in, the, future, most, organism, studied, to, date, utilize, a, mechanism, for, instance, worm, and, insect, can, alter, their, behavior, to, seek, food, source, or, to, avoid, danger, in, vertebrate, the, system, is, implemented, by, a, specific, set, of, brain, structure, at, the, heart, of, which, lie, the, basal, ganglion, a, set, of, interconnected, area, at, the, base, of, the, forebrain, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, the, basal, ganglion, are, the, central, site, at, which, decision, are, made, the, basal, ganglion, exert, a, sustained, inhibitory, control, over, most, of, the, motor, system, in, the, brain, when, this, inhibition, is, released, a, motor, system, is, permitted, to, execute, the, action, it, is, programmed, to, carry, out, reward, and, punishment, function, by, altering, the, relationship, between, the, input, that, the, basal, ganglion, receive, and, the, that, are, emitted, the, reward, mechanism, is, better, understood, than, the, punishment, mechanism, because, it, role, in, drug, abuse, ha, caused, it, to, be, studied, very, intensively, research, ha, shown, that, the, neurotransmitter, dopamine, play, a, central, role, addictive, drug, such, a, cocaine, amphetamine, and, nicotine, either, cause, dopamine, level, to, rise, or, cause, the, effect, of, dopamine, inside, the, brain, to, be, enhanced, learning, and, memory, almost, all, animal, are, capable, of, modifying, their, behavior, a, a, result, of, the, most, primitive, type, of, worm, because, behavior, is, driven, by, brain, activity, change, in, behavior, must, somehow, correspond, to, change, inside, the, brain, theorist, dating, back, to, santiago, y, cajal, argued, that, the, most, plausible, explanation, is, that, learning, and, memory, are, expressed, a, change, in, the, synaptic, connection, between, neuron, until, however, experimental, evidence, to, support, the, synaptic, plasticity, hypothesis, wa, lacking, in, tim, bliss, and, terje, published, a, paper, on, a, phenomenon, now, called, potentiation, the, paper, showed, clear, evidence, of, synaptic, change, that, lasted, for, at, least, several, day, since, then, technical, advance, have, made, these, sort, of, experiment, much, easier, to, carry, out, and, thousand, of, study, have, been, made, that, have, clarified, the, mechanism, of, synaptic, change, and, uncovered, other, type, of, synaptic, change, in, a, variety, of, brain, area, including, the, cerebral, cortex, hippocampus, basal, ganglion, and, cerebellum, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, and, physical, activity, appear, to, play, a, beneficial, role, in, the, process, neuroscientist, currently, distinguish, several, type, of, learning, and, memory, that, are, implemented, by, the, brain, in, distinct, way, working, memory, is, the, ability, of, the, brain, to, maintain, a, temporary, representation, of, information, about, the, task, that, an, animal, is, currently, engaged, in, this, sort, of, dynamic, memory, is, thought, to, be, mediated, by, the, formation, of, cell, of, activated, neuron, that, maintain, their, activity, by, constantly, stimulating, one, another, episodic, memory, is, the, ability, to, remember, the, detail, of, specific, event, this, sort, of, memory, can, last, for, a, lifetime, much, evidence, implicates, the, hippocampus, in, playing, a, crucial, role, people, with, severe, damage, to, the, hippocampus, sometimes, show, amnesia, that, is, inability, to, form, new, episodic, memory, semantic, memory, is, the, ability, to, learn, fact, and, relationship, this, sort, of, memory, is, probably, stored, largely, in, the, cerebral, cortex, mediated, by, change, in, connection, between, cell, that, represent, specific, type, of, information, instrumental, learning, is, the, ability, for, reward, and, punishment, to, modify, behavior, it, is, implemented, by, a, network, of, brain, area, centered, on, the, basal, ganglion, motor, learning, is, the, ability, to, refine, pattern, of, body, movement, by, practicing, or, more, generally, by, repetition, a, number, of, brain, area, are, involved, including, the, premotor, cortex, basal, ganglion, and, especially, the, cerebellum, which, function, a, a, large, memory, bank, for, microadjustments, of, the, parameter, of, movement, development, main, article, neural, development, brain, of, a, human, embryo, in, the, sixth, week, of, development, the, brain, doe, not, simply, grow, but, rather, develops, in, an, intricately, orchestrated, sequence, of, stage, it, change, in, shape, from, a, simple, swelling, at, the, front, of, the, nerve, cord, in, the, earliest, embryonic, stage, to, a, complex, array, of, area, and, connection, neuron, are, created, in, special, zone, that, contain, stem, cell, and, then, migrate, through, the, tissue, to, reach, their, ultimate, location, once, neuron, have, positioned, themselves, their, axon, sprout, and, navigate, through, the, brain, branching, and, extending, a, they, go, until, the, tip, reach, their, target, and, form, synaptic, connection, in, a, number, of, part, of, the, nervous, system, neuron, and, synapsis, are, produced, in, excessive, number, during, the, early, stage, and, then, the, unneeded, one, are, pruned, away, for, vertebrate, the, early, stage, of, neural, development, are, similar, across, all, specie, a, the, embryo, transforms, from, a, round, blob, of, cell, into, a, wormlike, structure, a, narrow, strip, of, ectoderm, running, along, the, midline, of, the, back, is, induced, to, become, the, neural, plate, the, precursor, of, the, nervous, system, the, neural, plate, fold, inward, to, form, the, neural, groove, and, then, the, lip, that, line, the, groove, merge, to, enclose, the, neural, tube, a, hollow, cord, of, cell, with, a, ventricle, at, the, center, at, the, front, end, the, ventricle, and, cord, swell, to, form, three, vesicle, that, are, the, precursor, of, the, forebrain, midbrain, and, hindbrain, at, the, next, stage, the, forebrain, split, into, two, vesicle, called, the, telencephalon, which, will, contain, the, cerebral, cortex, basal, ganglion, and, related, structure, and, the, diencephalon, which, will, contain, the, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, at, about, the, same, time, the, hindbrain, split, into, the, metencephalon, which, will, contain, the, cerebellum, and, pons, and, the, myelencephalon, which, will, contain, the, medulla, oblongata, each, of, these, area, contains, proliferative, zone, where, neuron, and, glial, cell, are, generated, the, resulting, cell, then, migrate, sometimes, for, long, distance, to, their, final, position, once, a, neuron, is, in, place, it, extends, dendrite, and, an, axon, into, the, area, around, it, axon, because, they, commonly, extend, a, great, distance, from, the, cell, body, and, need, to, reach, specific, target, grow, in, a, particularly, complex, way, the, tip, of, a, growing, axon, consists, of, a, blob, of, protoplasm, called, a, growth, cone, studded, with, chemical, receptor, these, receptor, sense, the, local, environment, causing, the, growth, cone, to, be, attracted, or, repelled, by, various, cellular, element, and, thus, to, be, pulled, in, a, particular, direction, at, each, point, along, it, path, the, result, of, this, pathfinding, process, is, that, the, growth, cone, navigates, through, the, brain, until, it, reach, it, destination, area, where, other, chemical, cue, cause, it, to, begin, generating, synapsis, considering, the, entire, brain, thousand, of, gene, create, product, that, influence, axonal, pathfinding, the, synaptic, network, that, finally, emerges, is, only, partly, determined, by, gene, though, in, many, part, of, the, brain, axon, initially, overgrow, and, then, are, pruned, by, mechanism, that, depend, on, neural, activity, in, the, projection, from, the, eye, to, the, midbrain, for, example, the, structure, in, the, adult, contains, a, very, precise, mapping, connecting, each, point, on, the, surface, of, the, retina, to, a, corresponding, point, in, a, midbrain, layer, in, the, first, stage, of, development, each, axon, from, the, retina, is, guided, to, the, right, general, vicinity, in, the, midbrain, by, chemical, cue, but, then, branch, very, profusely, and, make, initial, contact, with, a, wide, swath, of, midbrain, neuron, the, retina, before, birth, contains, special, mechanism, that, cause, it, to, generate, wave, of, activity, that, originate, spontaneously, at, a, random, point, and, then, propagate, slowly, across, the, retinal, layer, these, wave, are, useful, because, they, cause, neighboring, neuron, to, be, active, at, the, same, time, that, is, they, produce, a, neural, activity, pattern, that, contains, information, about, the, spatial, arrangement, of, the, neuron, this, information, is, exploited, in, the, midbrain, by, a, mechanism, that, cause, synapsis, to, weaken, and, eventually, vanish, if, activity, in, an, axon, is, not, followed, by, activity, of, the, target, cell, the, result, of, this, sophisticated, process, is, a, gradual, tuning, and, tightening, of, the, map, leaving, it, finally, in, it, precise, adult, form, similar, thing, happen, in, other, brain, area, an, initial, synaptic, matrix, is, generated, a, a, result, of, genetically, determined, chemical, guidance, but, then, gradually, refined, by, mechanism, partly, driven, by, internal, dynamic, partly, by, external, sensory, input, in, some, case, a, with, the, system, activity, pattern, depend, on, mechanism, that, operate, only, in, the, developing, brain, and, apparently, exist, solely, to, guide, development, in, human, and, many, other, mammal, new, neuron, are, created, mainly, before, birth, and, the, infant, brain, contains, substantially, more, neuron, than, the, adult, brain, there, are, however, a, few, area, where, new, neuron, continue, to, be, generated, throughout, life, the, two, area, for, which, adult, neurogenesis, is, well, established, are, the, olfactory, bulb, which, is, involved, in, the, sense, of, smell, and, the, dentate, gyrus, of, the, hippocampus, where, there, is, evidence, that, the, new, neuron, play, a, role, in, storing, newly, acquired, memory, with, these, exception, however, the, set, of, neuron, that, is, present, in, early, childhood, is, the, set, that, is, present, for, life, glial, cell, are, different, a, with, most, type, of, cell, in, the, body, they, are, generated, throughout, the, lifespan, there, ha, long, been, debate, about, whether, the, quality, of, mind, personality, and, intelligence, can, be, attributed, to, heredity, or, to, is, the, nature, and, nurture, controversy, although, many, detail, remain, to, be, settled, neuroscience, research, ha, clearly, shown, that, both, factor, are, important, gene, determine, the, general, form, of, the, brain, and, gene, determine, how, the, brain, reacts, to, experience, experience, however, is, required, to, refine, the, matrix, of, synaptic, connection, which, in, it, developed, form, contains, far, more, information, than, the, genome, doe, in, some, respect, all, that, matter, is, the, presence, or, absence, of, experience, during, critical, period, of, development, in, other, respect, the, quantity, and, quality, of, experience, are, important, for, example, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, animal, raised, in, enriched, environment, have, thicker, cerebral, cortex, indicating, a, higher, density, of, synaptic, connection, than, animal, whose, level, of, stimulation, are, restricted, research, main, article, neuroscience, the, human, brain, project, is, a, large, scientific, research, project, starting, in, which, aim, to, simulate, the, complete, human, brain, the, field, of, neuroscience, encompasses, all, approach, that, seek, to, understand, the, brain, and, the, rest, of, the, nervous, system, psychology, seek, to, understand, mind, and, behavior, and, neurology, is, the, medical, discipline, that, diagnosis, and, treat, disease, of, the, nervous, system, the, brain, is, also, the, most, important, organ, studied, in, psychiatry, the, branch, of, medicine, that, work, to, study, prevent, and, treat, mental, disorder, cognitive, science, seek, to, unify, neuroscience, and, psychology, with, other, field, that, concern, themselves, with, the, brain, such, a, computer, science, artificial, intelligence, and, similar, field, and, philosophy, the, oldest, method, of, studying, the, brain, is, anatomical, and, until, the, middle, of, the, century, much, of, the, progress, in, neuroscience, came, from, the, development, of, better, cell, stain, and, better, microscope, neuroanatomists, study, the, structure, of, the, brain, a, well, a, the, microscopic, structure, of, neuron, and, their, component, especially, synapsis, among, other, tool, they, employ, a, plethora, of, stain, that, reveal, neural, structure, chemistry, and, connectivity, in, recent, year, the, development, of, immunostaining, technique, ha, allowed, investigation, of, neuron, that, express, specific, set, of, gene, also, functional, neuroanatomy, us, medical, imaging, technique, to, correlate, variation, in, human, brain, structure, with, difference, in, cognition, or, behavior, neurophysiologists, study, the, chemical, pharmacological, and, electrical, property, of, the, brain, their, primary, tool, are, drug, and, recording, device, thousand, of, experimentally, developed, drug, affect, the, nervous, system, some, in, highly, specific, way, recording, of, brain, activity, can, be, made, using, electrode, either, glued, to, the, scalp, a, in, eeg, study, or, implanted, inside, the, brain, of, animal, for, extracellular, recording, which, can, detect, action, potential, generated, by, individual, neuron, because, the, brain, doe, not, contain, pain, receptor, it, is, possible, using, these, technique, to, record, brain, activity, from, animal, that, are, awake, and, behaving, without, causing, distress, the, same, technique, have, occasionally, been, used, to, study, brain, activity, in, human, patient, suffering, from, intractable, epilepsy, in, case, where, there, wa, a, medical, necessity, to, implant, electrode, to, localize, the, brain, area, responsible, for, epileptic, seizure, functional, imaging, technique, such, a, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, are, also, used, to, study, brain, activity, these, technique, have, mainly, been, used, with, human, subject, because, they, require, a, conscious, subject, to, remain, motionless, for, long, period, of, time, but, they, have, the, great, advantage, of, being, noninvasive, design, of, an, experiment, in, which, brain, activity, from, a, monkey, wa, used, to, control, a, robotic, arm, another, approach, to, brain, function, is, to, examine, the, consequence, of, damage, to, specific, brain, area, even, though, it, is, protected, by, the, skull, and, meninges, surrounded, by, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, isolated, from, the, bloodstream, by, the, barrier, the, delicate, nature, of, the, brain, make, it, vulnerable, to, numerous, disease, and, several, type, of, damage, in, human, the, effect, of, stroke, and, other, type, of, brain, damage, have, been, a, key, source, of, information, about, brain, function, because, there, is, no, ability, to, experimentally, control, the, nature, of, the, damage, however, this, information, is, often, difficult, to, interpret, in, animal, study, most, commonly, involving, rat, it, is, possible, to, use, electrode, or, locally, injected, chemical, to, produce, precise, pattern, of, damage, and, then, examine, the, consequence, for, behavior, computational, neuroscience, encompasses, two, approach, first, the, use, of, computer, to, study, the, brain, second, the, study, of, how, brain, perform, computation, on, one, hand, it, is, possible, to, write, a, computer, program, to, simulate, the, operation, of, a, group, of, neuron, by, making, use, of, system, of, equation, that, describe, their, electrochemical, activity, such, simulation, are, known, a, biologically, realistic, neural, network, on, the, other, hand, it, is, possible, to, study, algorithm, for, neural, computation, by, simulating, or, mathematically, analyzing, the, operation, of, simplified, unit, that, have, some, of, the, property, of, neuron, but, abstract, out, much, of, their, biological, complexity, the, computational, function, of, the, brain, are, studied, both, by, computer, scientist, and, neuroscientist, recent, year, have, seen, increasing, application, of, genetic, and, genomic, technique, to, the, study, of, the, brain, and, a, focus, on, the, role, of, neurotrophic, factor, and, physical, activity, in, neuroplasticity, the, most, common, subject, are, mouse, because, of, the, availability, of, technical, tool, it, is, now, possible, with, relative, ease, to, knock, out, or, mutate, a, wide, variety, of, gene, and, then, examine, the, effect, on, brain, function, more, sophisticated, approach, are, also, being, used, for, example, using, recombination, it, is, possible, to, activate, or, deactivate, gene, in, specific, part, of, the, brain, at, specific, time, history, illustration, by, descartes, of, how, the, brain, implement, a, reflex, response, see, also, history, of, neuroscience, early, philosopher, were, divided, a, to, whether, the, seat, of, the, soul, lie, in, the, brain, or, heart, aristotle, favored, the, heart, and, thought, that, the, function, of, the, brain, wa, merely, to, cool, the, blood, democritus, the, inventor, of, the, atomic, theory, of, matter, argued, for, a, soul, with, intellect, in, the, head, emotion, in, the, heart, and, lust, near, the, liver, hippocrates, the, father, of, medicine, came, down, unequivocally, in, favor, of, the, brain, in, his, treatise, on, epilepsy, he, wrote, men, ought, to, know, that, from, nothing, else, but, the, brain, come, joy, delight, laughter, and, sport, and, sorrow, grief, despondency, and, lamentation, and, by, the, same, organ, we, become, mad, and, delirious, and, fear, and, terror, assail, u, some, by, night, and, some, by, day, and, dream, and, untimely, wandering, and, care, that, are, not, suitable, and, ignorance, of, present, circumstance, desuetude, and, unskillfulness, all, these, thing, we, endure, from, the, brain, when, it, is, not, healthy, hippocrates, on, the, sacred, disease, andreas, vesalius, fabrica, published, in, showing, the, base, of, the, human, brain, including, optic, chiasma, cerebellum, olfactory, bulb, etc, the, roman, physician, galen, also, argued, for, the, importance, of, the, brain, and, theorized, in, some, depth, about, how, it, might, work, galen, traced, out, the, anatomical, relationship, among, brain, nerve, and, muscle, demonstrating, that, all, muscle, in, the, body, are, connected, to, the, brain, through, a, branching, network, of, nerve, he, postulated, that, nerve, activate, muscle, mechanically, by, carrying, a, mysterious, substance, he, called, pneumata, psychikon, usually, translated, a, animal, spirit, galen, idea, were, widely, known, during, the, middle, age, but, not, much, further, progress, came, until, the, renaissance, when, detailed, anatomical, study, resumed, combined, with, the, theoretical, speculation, of, descartes, and, those, who, followed, him, descartes, like, galen, thought, of, the, nervous, system, in, hydraulic, term, he, believed, that, the, highest, cognitive, function, are, carried, out, by, a, re, cogitans, but, that, the, majority, of, behavior, of, human, and, all, behavior, of, animal, could, be, explained, mechanistically, the, first, real, progress, toward, a, modern, understanding, of, nervous, function, though, came, from, the, investigation, of, luigi, galvani, who, discovered, that, a, shock, of, static, electricity, applied, to, an, exposed, nerve, of, a, dead, frog, could, cause, it, leg, to, contract, since, that, time, each, major, advance, in, understanding, ha, followed, more, or, le, directly, from, the, development, of, a, new, technique, of, investigation, until, the, early, year, of, the, century, the, most, important, advance, were, derived, from, new, method, for, staining, cell, particularly, critical, wa, the, invention, of, the, golgi, stain, which, when, correctly, used, stain, only, a, small, fraction, of, neuron, but, stain, them, in, their, entirety, including, cell, body, dendrite, and, axon, without, such, a, stain, brain, tissue, under, a, microscope, appears, a, an, impenetrable, tangle, of, protoplasmic, fiber, in, which, it, is, impossible, to, determine, any, structure, in, the, hand, of, camillo, golgi, and, especially, of, the, spanish, neuroanatomist, santiago, y, cajal, the, new, stain, revealed, hundred, of, distinct, type, of, neuron, each, with, it, own, unique, dendritic, structure, and, pattern, of, connectivity, drawing, by, santiago, y, cajal, of, two, type, of, neuron, from, the, cerebellum, of, a, pigeon, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, advance, in, electronics, enabled, investigation, of, the, electrical, property, of, nerve, cell, culminating, in, work, by, alan, hodgkin, andrew, huxley, and, others, on, the, biophysics, of, the, action, potential, and, the, work, of, bernard, katz, and, others, on, the, electrochemistry, of, the, synapse, these, study, complemented, the, anatomical, picture, with, a, conception, of, the, brain, a, a, dynamic, entity, reflecting, the, new, understanding, in, charles, sherrington, visualized, the, working, of, the, brain, waking, from, sleep, the, great, topmost, sheet, of, the, mass, that, where, hardly, a, light, had, twinkled, or, moved, becomes, now, a, sparkling, field, of, rhythmic, flashing, point, with, train, of, traveling, spark, hurrying, hither, and, thither, the, brain, is, waking,

bladder, while, a, number, of, carp, trout, herring, catfish, eel, have, retained, the, physostome, condition, with, the, sack, being, open, to, the, esophagus, in, more, basal, bony, fish, such, a, the, gar, bichir, bowfin, and, the, fish, the, bladder, have, evolved, to, primarily, function, a, lung, the, fish, gave, rise, to, the, tetrapod, thus, the, lung, of, vertebrate, are, homologous, to, the, gas, bladder, of, fish, but, not, to, their, gill, this, is, reflected, by, the, fact, that, the, lung, of, a, fetus, also, develop, from, an, outpocketing, of, the, esophagus, and, in, the, case, of, the, physostome, gas, bladder, which, can, serve, a, both, buoyancy, organ, and, with, the, pneumatic, duct, to, the, gut, also, serve, a, lung, this, condition, is, found, in, more,
