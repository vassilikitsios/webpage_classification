difficult, to, keep, up, with, the, handwriting, demand, of, school, and, their, writing, may, be, difficult, to, read, in, addition, writing, may, take, longer, and, require, greater, effort, on, the, student, part, factor, linked, to, handwriting, include, postural, stability, sensory, and, perceptual, ability, of, the, hand, and, writing, tool, pressure, speech, impairment, may, be, seen, in, child, with, cp, depending, on, the, severity, of, brain, damage, communication, in, a, school, setting, is, important, because, communicating, with, peer, and, teacher, is, very, much, a, part,

with, a, disability, leisure, can, be, divided, into, structured, formal, and, unstructured, informal, activity, study, show, that, child, with, disability, like, cp, participate, mainly, in, informal, activity, that, are, carried, out, in, the, family, environment, and, are, organised, by, adult, typically, child, with, disability, carry, out, leisure, activity, by, themselves, or, with,

level, micro, meso, and, macro, first, the, barrier, at, the, micro, level, involve, the, person, barrier, at, the, micro, level, include, the, child, physical, limitation, motor, sensory, and, cognitive, impairment, or, their, subjective, feeling, regarding, their, ability, to, participate, for, example, the, child, may, not, participate, in, group, activity, due, to, lack, of, confidence, second, barrier, at, the, meso, level, include, the, family, and, community, these, may, include, negative, attitude, of, people, toward, disability, or, lack, of, support, within, the, family, or, in, the, community, one, of, the, main, reason, for, this, limited, support, appears, to, be, the, result, of, a, lack, of, awareness, and, knowledge, regarding, the, child, ability, to, engage, in, activity, despite, his, or, her, disability, third, barrier, at, the, macro, level, incorporate, the, system, and, policy, that, are, not, in, place, or, hinder, child, with, cp, these, may, be, environmental, barrier, to, participation, such, a, architectural, barrier, lack, of, relevant, assistive, technology, and, transportation, difficulty, due, to, limited, wheelchair, access, or,

form, around, other, part, of, the, fetus, and, cause, amputation, or, even, intrauterine, death, see, type, and, classification, the, anatomy, proximal, to, the, site, of, constriction, or, amputation, is, developmentally, normal, cr, can, be, associated, with, other, malformation, with, club, foot, being, most, common, see, also, type, and, classification, the, precise, configuration, of, the, band, lymphedema, and, character, of, the, amputation, are, not, predictable, and, vary, with, each, individual, patient, also, more, than, one, extremity, is, usually, affected, and, it, is,

reference, diagnosis, edit, the, diagnosis, of, constriction, ring, syndrome, can, be, confirmed, with, an, ultrasonography, the, clinical, manifestation, can, be, extremely, variable, it, could, be, a, single, or, multiple, manifestation, this, can, be, confirmed, at, the, end, of, the, first, trimester, or, at, the, beginning, of, the, second, trimester, but, not, every, patient, will, be, diagnosed, at, that, moment, most, will, get, this, diagnosis, at, birth, differential, diagnosis, the, differential, diagnosis, includes, symbrachydactyly, chorionic, villus, sampling, congenital,

nail, or, nail, etiology, edit, there, are, three, different, theory, to, the, etiology, of, the, constriction, ring, syndrome, the, first, is, the, intrinsic, theory, which, wa, proposed, by, streeter, in, implicates, an, anomaly, in, germ, plasm, resulting, in, the, defect, this, theory, is, reinforced, by, the, clinical, presentation, of, the, constriction, ring, with, other, internal, visceral, and, systematic, anomaly, because, of, these, other, anomaly, the, name, ring, band, and, are, given, to, this, the, second, theory, postulate, the, involvement, of, an, intrauterine, disruption, during, pregnancy, followed, by, a, cascade, of, event, involving, amniotic, rupture, when, spontaneous, rupture, of, the, amnion, occurs, early, in, the, second, trimester, the, separation, of, amnion, from, chorion, produce, many, small, thin, strand, that, can, become, entangled, within, digit, and, toe, the, name, band, disruption, complex, amniochorionic, mesoblastic, fibrous, string, are, based, on, this, theory, the, third, theory, postulate, the, involvement, of, intrauterine, trauma, intrauterine, trauma, could, be, something, like, amniocentesis, or, something, like, an, fetal, surgery, an, intrauterine, trauma, could, result, in, hemorrhage, leading, to, acrosyndactyly, one, study, also, showed, the, presence, of, band, a, confirmed, by, sonography, after, fetal, surgery, because, of, these, different, theory, there, are, many, name, for, this, syndrome, for, a, long, time, people, believed, the, second, theory, about, the, amniotic, rupture, and, strand, in, the, research, case, not, every, child, had, a, real, amniotic, strand, it, could, be, that, there, ha, to, be, another, explanation, for, the, development, of, these, anomaly, type, classification, edit, the, constriction, ring, syndrome, is, a, complex, collection, of, asymmetric, congenital, anomaly, in, which, no, two, case, are, exactly, alike, this, is, why, a, classification, is, difficult, to, make, the, most, widely, used, classification, system, wa, proposed, by, patterson, this, classification, system, is, based, on, the, severity, of, the, syndrome, and, is, useful, because, the, different, type, require, different, treatment, other, clinician, have, amended, this, scheme, by, separating, the, depth, of, the, ring, into, mild, moderate, severe, and, amputation, and, by, further, defining, the, presence, or, absence, of, lymphedema, or, soft, tissue, loss, distal, to, the, ring, expanding, over, subdivision, in, depth, of, the, cleft, for, every, classification, is, not, necessary, because, the, principle, of, treatment, and, technique, for, correction, are, the, same, there, are, four, category, simply, constriction, ring, constriction, ring, associated, with, deformity, of, the, distal, part, with, or, without, lymphedema, constriction, ring, associated, with, acrosyndactyly, uterine, amputation, patterson, divided, the, constriction, ring, associated, with, acrosyndactyly, into, three, type, type, i, conjoined, fingertip, with, web, of, the, proper, depth, type, ii, the, tip, of, the, digit, are, joined, but, web, formation, is, not, complete, type, iii, joined, tip, sinus, tract, between, digit, and, absent, web, patterson, i, there, are, simple, constriction, ring, which, are, strand, most, commonly, around, the, distal, extremity, a, finger, and, toe, in, general, the, thumb, is, not, likely, to, be, affected, by, a, constriction, ring, because, the, fetus, typically, hold, the, thumb, in, tight, adduction, flexion, making, entanglement, with, strand, le, likely, these, malformation, need, to, be, surgically, removed, which, must, be, executed, in, different, stage, and, can, done, by, different, technique, see, also, treatment, patterson, ii, the, cr, involves, strand, which, obstruct, the, lymphatic, vessel, and, thus, causing, fluid, retention, distal, of, the, affected, extremity, this, utters, itself, with, swollen, part, distal, of, the, constriction, patterson, iii, in, this, form, there, is, a, complex, form, of, syndactyly, named, acrosyndactyly, the, finger, or, toe, were, initially, separated, but, due, to, the, constriction, they, are, formed, back, together, sometimes, multiple, finger, can, be, involved, the, distal, fusion, between, digit, or, toe, never, initially, involves, a, skeletal, coalition, the, digit, are, usually, hypoplastic, if, multiple, digit, are, involved, when, the, constriction, cut, of, the, blood, supply, to, the, finger, the, finger, can, form, a, peak, with, the, most, palmar, digit, being, the, index, finger, normal, neurovascular, bundle, are, not, present, in, the, distal, part, hand, with, fused, finger, need, to, be, released, in, phase, to, preserve, the, distal, blood, supply, paterson, iv, one, of, the, most, severe, consequence, of, constriction, strain, is, probably, intrauterine, amputation, this, is, where, the, constriction, go, a, deep, a, the, bone, and, cut, of, the, blood, supply, of, the, proximal, extremity, the, result, will, be, that, the, developing, toe, or, finger, will, become, ischemic, and, will, fall, of, because, the, end, result, is, a, transverse, amputation, that, cut, off, the, vascular, supply, to, the, developing, extremity, the, actual, constriction, ring, is, not, seen, this, can, result, in, different, outcome, complete, resorption, this, is, the, most, common, form, of, amputation, in, this, form, the, amputated, digit, is, completely, resorbed, during, intrauterine, development, and, therefore, the, amputated, digit, be, found, recovery, of, the, digit, the, digit, is, recovered, with, the, placenta, during, delivery, engraftment, elsewhere, the, amputated, digit, can, be, in, rare, case, engrafted, somewhere, on, the, fetus, intrauterine, death, in, extremely, rare, case, a, strain, can, form, around, the, umbilical, cord, and, cut, off, the, blood, supply, to, the, fetus, which, will, result, in, intrauterine, death, malformation, associated, with, constriction, ring, syndrome, the, percentage, of, associated, anomaly, varies, from, to, a, high, a, constriction, ring, deformity, are, a, common, on, the, lower, extremity, a, on, the, upper, almost, all, of, these, involve, the, musculoskeletal, system, with, clubbed, foot, being, the, most, common, in, up, to, of, reported, case, large, reported, series, reveal, an, incidence, between, and, of, craniofacial, malformation, with, clefting, of, the, lip, or, palate, epidemiology, edit, the, reported, incidence, of, constriction, ring, syndrome, varies, from, and, live, birth, the, prevalence, is, equally, in, male, and, female, fetomaternal, factor, like, prematurity, maternal, illnes, low, birth, weight, and, maternal, drug, exposure, are, predisposing, factor, for, the, constriction, ring, syndrome, no, positive, relationship, between, cr, and, genetic, inheritance, ha, been, reported, treatment, edit, surgical, correction, is, recommended, when, a, constriction, ring, result, in, a, limb, contour, deformity, with, or, without, lymphedema, surgical, technique, at, the, beginning, of, the, surgery, a, tourniquet, will, be, applied, to, the, limb, a, tourniquet, compress, and, control, the, arterial, and, venous, circulation, for, about, hour, the, constriction, band, must, be, dissected, very, carefully, to, avoid, damaging, the, underlying, neurovasculature, when, the, constriction, band, is, excised, there, will, be, a, direct, closure, this, allows, the, fatty, tissue, to, naturally, reposition, itself, under, the, skin, complete, circumferential, constriction, band, it, is, recommended, that, a, correction, approach, be, used, at, the, first, operation, of, the, circumference, is, excised, and, the, other, can, be, excised, after, three, to, six, month, this, will, avoid, any, problem, to, the, distal, circulation, in, the, limb, which, may, already, be, compromised, lymphedema, when, present, will, significantly, improve, within, a, few, week, of, the, first, for, the, direct, closure, of, the, defect, after, dissecting, a, constriction, band, there, are, two, different, technique, triangular, flap, for, this, technique, the, circumference, between, the, two, border, must, be, measured, depending, on, the, difference, the, number, of, triangular, flap, can, be, decided, with, a, triangular, flap, you, can, create, more, skin, is, a, plastic, surgery, technique, that, is, used, to, improve, the, functional, and, cosmetic, appearance, of, scar, it, can, elongate, a, contracted, scar, or, rotate, the, scar, tension, line, the, middle, line, of, the, incision, the, central, element, is, made, along, the, line, of, greatest, tension, or, contraction, and, triangular, flap, are, raised, on, opposite, side, of, the, two, end, and, then, in, rare, case, if, diagnosed, in, utero, fetal, surgery, may, be, considered, to, save, a, limb, which, is, in, danger, of, amputation, or, other, deformity, this, typically, would, not, be, attempted, if, neither, vital, organ, nor, the, umbilical, cord, were, affected, this, operation, ha, been, successfully, performed, on, fetus, a, young, a, week, the, surgery, took, place, at, melbourne, monash, medical, centre, in, australia, and, is, believed, to, be,

parasitic, twin, parasitic, twin, are, known, to, occur, in, utero, when, monozygotic, twin, start, to, develop, a, an, embryo, but, the, embryo, fails, to, completely, split, when, this, happens, one, embryo, will, dominate, development, while, the, other, development, is, severely, altered, the, key, difference, between, a, parasitic, twin, and, conjoined, twin, is, that, in, parasitic, twin,

lead, to, one, inner, cell, mass, and, one, blastocyst, then, a, the, twin, develop, they, will, share, the, same, placenta, chorion, and, amnion, this, is, thought, to, be, the, most, likely, reason, why, conjoined, twin, occur, and, could, possibly, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, craniopagus, parasiticus, citation, needed, one, hypothesis, is, that, craniopagus, parasiticus, start, with, the, development, of, two, fetus, from, a, single, zygote, that, fail, to, separate, at, the, head, region, around, the, second, week, of, gestation, some, who, believe, however, that, it, occurs, later, in, development, around, the, fourth, week, of, gestation, at, which, time, the, two, embryo, fuse, together, near, the, anterior, open, neuropore, another, hypothesis, is, that, there, is, joining, of, the, somatic, and, placental, vascular, system, of, the, twin, a, well, a, a, degeneration, of, the, umbilical, cord, of, the, parasitic, twin, this, suggests, that, craniopagus, parasiticus, develops, due, to, the, lack, of, blood, supply, to, one, of, the, twin, the, condition, also, seems, to, be, more, predominant, in, male, than, female, with, seven, of, the, nine,

assisted, reproductive, technique, the, main, cause, of, infertility, in, men, with, cystic, fibrosis, is, congenital, absence, of, the, va, deferens, which, normally, connects, the, testis, to, the, ejaculatory, duct, of, the, penis, but, potentially, also, by, other, mechanism, such, a, causing, no, sperm, teratospermia, and, few, sperm, with, poor, motility, many, men, found, to, have, congenital, absence, of, the, va, deferens, during, evaluation, for, infertility, have, a, mild, previously, undiagnosed, form, of, cf, approximately, of, woman, with, cf, have, fertility, difficulty, due, to, thickened, cervical, mucus, or, malnutrition, in, severe, case, malnutrition, disrupts, ovulation, and, cause, amenorrhea, cause, edit, cystic, fibrosis, ha, an, autosomal, recessive, pattern, of, inheritance, cf, is, caused, by, a, mutation, in, the, gene, cystic, fibrosis, transmembrane, conductance, regulator, cftr, the, most, common, mutation, is, a, deletion, signifying, deletion, of, three, nucleotide, that, result, in, a, loss, of, the, amino, acid, phenylalanine, f, at, the, position, on, the, protein, this, mutation, account, for, of, cf, case, worldwide, and, of, case, in, the, united, state, however, there, are, over, other, mutation, that, can, produce, cf, although, most, people, have, two, working, copy, allele, of, the, cftr, gene, only, one, is, needed, to, prevent, cystic, fibrosis, cf, develops, when, neither, allele, can, produce, a, functional, cftr, protein, thus, cf, is, considered, an, autosomal, recessive, disease, the, cftr, gene, found, at, the, locus, of, chromosome, is, base, pair, long, and, creates, a, protein, that, is, amino, acid, long, more, specifically, the, location, is, between, base, pair, to, on, the, long, arm, of, chromosome, region, band, represented, a, structurally, cftr, is, a, type, of, gene, known, a, an, abc, gene, the, product, of, this, gene, the, cftr, is, a, chloride, ion, channel, important, in, creating, sweat, digestive, juice, and, mucus, this, protein, posse, two, domain, which, allows, the, protein, to, use, energy, in, the, form, of, atp, it, also, contains, two, domain, comprising, alpha, helix, apiece, which, allow, the, protein, to, cross, the, cell, membrane, a, regulatory, binding, site, on, the, protein, allows, activation, by, phosphorylation, mainly, by, protein, kinase, the, carboxyl, terminal, of, the, protein, is, anchored, to, the, cytoskeleton, by, a, pdz, domain, interaction, in, addition, there, is, increasing, evidence, that, genetic, modifier, besides, cftr, modulate, the, frequency, and, severity, of, the, disease, one, example, is, lectin, which, is, involved, in, innate, immunity, by, facilitating, phagocytosis, of, microorganism, polymorphism, in, one, or, both, lectin, allele, that, result, in, lower, circulating, level, of, the, protein, are, associated, with, a, threefold, higher, risk, of, lung, disease, a, well, a, an, increased, burden, of, chronic, bacterial, infection, pathophysiology, edit, the, cftr, protein, is, a, channel, protein, that, control, the, flow, of, and, ion, in, and, out, of, cell, inside, the, lung, when, the, cftr, protein, is, working, correctly, a, shown, in, panel, ion, freely, flow, in, and, out, of, the, cell, however, when, the, cftr, protein, is, malfunctioning, a, in, panel, these, ion, can, not, flow, out, of, the, cell, due, to, a, blocked, channel, this, cause, cystic, fibrosis, characterized, by, the, buildup, of, thick, mucus, in, the, lung, there, are, several, mutation, in, the, cftr, gene, and, different, mutation, cause, different, defect, in, the, cftr, protein, sometimes, causing, a, milder, or, more, severe, disease, these, protein, defect, are, also, target, for, drug, which, can, sometimes, restore, their, function, which, occurs, in, of, patient, in, the, creates, a, protein, that, doe, not, fold, normally, and, is, degraded, by, the, cell, other, mutation, result, in, protein, that, are, too, short, truncated, because, production, is, ended, prematurely, other, mutation, produce, protein, that, do, not, use, energy, normally, do, not, allow, chloride, iodide, and, thiocyanate, to, cross, the, membrane, appropriately, degrade, at, a, faster, rate, than, normal, mutation, may, also, lead, to, fewer, copy, of, the, cftr, protein, being, produced, the, protein, created, by, this, gene, is, anchored, to, the, outer, membrane, of, cell, in, the, sweat, gland, lung, pancreas, and, all, other, remaining, exocrine, gland, in, the, body, the, protein, span, this, membrane, and, act, a, a, channel, connecting, the, inner, part, of, the, cell, cytoplasm, to, the, surrounding, fluid, this, channel, is, primarily, responsible, for, controlling, the, movement, of, halogen, from, inside, to, outside, of, the, cell, however, in, the, sweat, duct, it, facilitates, the, movement, of, chloride, from, the, sweat, duct, into, the, cytoplasm, when, the, cftr, protein, doe, not, resorb, ion, in, sweat, duct, chloride, and, thiocyanate, released, from, sweat, gland, are, trapped, inside, the, duct, and, pumped, to, the, skin, additionally, hypothiocyanite, oscn, can, not, be, produced, by, the, immune, defense, system, because, chloride, is, negatively, charged, this, creates, a, difference, in, the, electrical, potential, inside, and, outside, the, cell, causing, cation, to, cross, into, the, cell, sodium, is, the, most, common, cation, in, the, extracellular, space, the, excess, chloride, within, sweat, duct, prevents, sodium, resorption, by, epithelial, sodium, channel, and, the, combination, of, sodium, and, chloride, creates, the, salt, which, is, lost, in, high, amount, in, the, sweat, of, individual, with, cf, this, lost, salt, form, the, basis, for, the, sweat, test, most, of, the, damage, in, cf, is, due, to, blockage, of, the, narrow, passage, of, affected, organ, with, thickened, secretion, these, blockage, lead, to, remodeling, and, infection, in, the, lung, damage, by, accumulated, digestive, enzyme, in, the, pancreas, blockage, of, the, intestine, by, thick, faeces, etc, there, are, several, theory, on, how, the, defect, in, the, protein, and, cellular, function, cause, the, clinical, effect, the, most, current, theory, suggests, that, defective, ion, transport, lead, to, dehydration, in, the, airway, epithelium, thickening, mucus, in, airway, epithelial, cell, the, cilium, exist, in, between, the, cell, apical, surface, and, mucus, in, a, layer, known, a, airway, surface, liquid, asl, the, flow, of, ion, from, the, cell, and, into, this, layer, is, determined, by, ion, channel, like, cftr, cftr, not, only, allows, chloride, ion, to, be, drawn, from, the, cell, and, into, the, asl, but, it, also, regulates, another, channel, called, enac, enac, allows, sodium, ion, to, leave, the, asl, and, enter, the, respiratory, epithelium, cftr, normally, inhibits, this, channel, but, if, the, cftr, is, defective, then, sodium, will, flow, freely, from, the, asl, and, into, the, cell, a, water, follows, sodium, the, depth, of, asl, will, be, depleted, and, the, cilium, will, be, left, in, the, mucous, layer, a, cilium, can, not, effectively, move, in, a, thick, viscous, environment, there, is, deficient, mucociliary, clearance, and, a, build, up, of, mucous, clogging, small, airway, the, accumulation, of, more, viscous, mucus, in, the, lung, allows, bacteria, to, hide, from, the, body, immune, system, causing, repeated, respiratory, infection, the, presence, of, the, same, cftr, protein, in, pancreatic, duct, and, skin, cell, are, what, cause, symptom, in, these, system, chronic, infection, edit, the, lung, of, individual, with, cystic, fibrosis, are, colonized, and, infected, by, bacteria, from, an, early, age, these, bacteria, which, often, spread, among, individual, with, cf, thrive, in, the, altered, mucus, which, collect, in, the, small, airway, of, the, lung, this, mucus, lead, to, the, formation, of, bacterial, microenvironments, known, a, biofilms, that, are, difficult, for, immune, cell, and, antibiotic, to, penetrate, viscous, secretion, and, persistent, respiratory, infection, repeatedly, damage, the, lung, by, gradually, remodeling, the, airway, which, make, infection, even, more, difficult, to, eradicate, over, time, both, the, type,

or, in, rare, instance, in, individual, with, two, normal, copy, of, the, cftr, gene, due, to, these, false, positive, cf, screening, in, newborn, can, be, controversial, most, state, and, country, do, not, screen, for, cf, routinely, at, birth, therefore, most, individual, are, diagnosed, after, symptom, sinopulmonary, disease, and, gi, manifestation, prompt, an, evaluation, for, cystic, fibrosis, the, most, commonly, used, form, of, testing, is, the, sweat, test, involves, application, of, a, medication, that, stimulates, sweating, pilocarpine, to, deliver, the, medication, through, the, skin, iontophoresis, is, used, to, whereby, one, electrode, is, placed, onto, the, applied, medication, and, an, electric, current, is, passed, to, a, separate, electrode, on, the, skin, the, resultant, sweat, is, then, collected, on, filter, paper, or, in, a, capillary, tube, and, analyzed, for, abnormal, amount, of, sodium, and, chloride, people, with, cf, have, increased, amount, of, sodium, and, chloride, in, their, sweat, in, contrast, people, with, cf, have, le, thiocyanate, and, hypothiocyanite, in, their, saliva, and, mucus, banfi, et, cf, can, also, be, diagnosed, by, identification, of, mutation, in, the, cftr, gene, people, with, cf, may, be, listed, in, a, disease, registry, that, allows, researcher, and, doctor, to, track, health, result, and, identify, candidate, for, clinical, trial, prenatal, edit, couple, who, are, pregnant, or, planning, a, pregnancy, can, have, themselves, tested, for, the, cftr, gene, mutation, to, determine, the, risk, that, their, child, will, be, born, with, cystic, fibrosis, testing, is, typically, performed, first, on, one, or, both, parent, and, if, the, risk, of, cf, is, high, testing, on, the, fetus, is, performed, the, american, college, of, obstetrician, and, gynecologist, acog, recommends, testing, for, couple, who, have, a, personal, or, close, family, history, of, cf, and, they, recommend, that, carrier, testing, be, offered, to, all, caucasian, couple, and, be, made, available, to, couple, of, other, ethnic, background, because, development, of, cf, in, the, fetus, requires, each, parent, to, pas, on, a, mutated, copy, of, the, cftr, gene, and, because, cf, testing, is, expensive, testing, is, often, performed, initially, on, one, parent, if, testing, show, that, parent, is, a, cftr, gene, mutation, carrier, the, other, parent, is, tested, to, calculate, the, risk, that, their, child, will, have, cf, cf, can, result, from, more, than, a, thousand, different, mutation, and, a, of, it,

to, show, a, relation, between, exposure, to, maternal, mumps, in, fetal, life, efe, and, a, positive, skin, test, for, mumps, in, infant, this, brought, on, a, large, ongoing, controversy, and,

single, strategy, for, treatment, of, facial, cleft, because, of, the, large, amount, of, variation, in, these, cleft, which, kind, of, surgery, is, used, depends, on, the, type, of, clefting, and, which, structure, are, involved, there, is, much, discussion, about, the, timing, of, reconstruction, of, bone, and, soft, tissue, the, problem, with, early, reconstruction, is, the, recurrence, of, the, deformity, due, to, the, intrinsic, restricted, growth, this, requires, additional, operation, at, a, later, age, to, make, sure, all, part, of, the, face, are, in, proportion, a, disadvantage, of, early, bone, reconstruction, is, the, chance, to, damage, the, tooth, germ, which, are, located, in, the, maxilla, just, under, the, orbit, the, soft, tissue, reconstruction, can, be, done, at, an, early, age, but, only, if, the, used, skin, flap, can, be, used, again, during, a, second, operation, the, timing, of, the, operation, depends, on, the, urgency, of, the, underlying, condition, if, the, operation, is, necessary, to, function, properly, it, should, be, done, at, early, age, the, best, aesthetic, result, is, achieved, when, the, incision, are, positioned, in, area, which, attract, the, least, attention, they, cover, up, the, scar, if, however, the, function, of, a, part, of, the, face, damaged, the, operation, depends, on, psychological, factor, and, the, facial, area, of, reconstruction, the, treatment, plan, of, a, facial, cleft, is, planned, right, after, diagnosis, this, plan, includes, every, operation, needed, in, the, first, year, of, the, patient, life, to, reconstruct, the, face, fully, in, this, plan, a, difference, is, made, between, problem, that, need, to, be, solved, to, improve, the, health, of, the, patient, coloboma, and, problem, that, need, to, be, solved, for, a, better, cosmetic, result, hypertelorism, the, treatment, of, the, facial, cleft, can, be, divided, in, different, area, of, the, face, the, cranial, anomaly, the, orbital, and, eye, anomaly, the, nose, anomaly, the, midface, anomaly, and, the, mouth, anomaly, treatment, of, the, cranial, anomaly, edit, the, most, common, cranial, anomaly, seen, in, combination, with, facial, cleft, is, encephalocele, encephalocele, edit, the, treatment, of, encephalocele, is, based, on, surgery, to, repair, the, bony, gap, and, provide, adequate, protection, of, the, underlying, brain, the, question, remains, if, the, external, brain, tissue, should, be, put, back, into, the, skull, or, if, it, is, possible, to, cut, off, that, piece, of, brain, tissue, because, it, claimed, that, the, external, piece, of, brain, tissue, often, functional, with, the, exception, of, a, basal, encephalocele, in, which, the, pituitary, gland, can, be, found, in, the, mouth, treatment, of, orbital, eye, anomaly, edit, the, most, common, orbital, anomaly, seen, in, child, with, facial, cleft, are, and, vertical, dystopia, coloboma, edit, the, coloboma, which, occurs, often, in, facial, cleft, is, a, cleft, in, the, lower, or, upper, eyelid, this, should, be, closed, a, soon, a, possible, to, prevent, drought, of, the, eye, and, a, consecutive, loss, of, vision, vertical, orbital, dystopia, edit, vertical, orbital, dystopia, can, occur, in, facial, cleft, when, the, orbital, floor, the, maxilla, is, involved, in, the, cleft, vertical, orbital, dystopia, mean, that, the, eye, do, not, lay, on, the, same, horizontal, line, in, the, face, one, eye, is, positioned, lower, than, the, other, the, treatment, is, based, on, the, reconstruction, of, this, orbital, floor, by, either, closing, the, boney, cleft, or, reconstructing, the, orbital, floor, using, a, bone, graft, hypertelorism, edit, there, are, many, type, of, operation, which, can, be, performed, to, treat, a, hypertelorism, option, are, box, osteotomy, and, facial, bipartition, also, referred, to, a, a, median, fasciotomy, the, goal, of, the, box, osteotomy, is, to, bring, the, orbit, closer, together, by, removing, a, part, of, the, bone, between, the, orbit, to, detach, both, orbit, from, the, surrounding, bone, structure, and, move, both, orbit, more, to, the, centre, of, the, face, the, goal, of, the, facial, bipartition, is, not, only, to, bring, the, orbit, closer, together, but, also, to, create, more, space, in, the, maxilla, this, can, be, done, by, splitting, the, maxilla, and, the, frontal, bone, remove, a, triangular, shaped, piece, of, bone, from, the, forehead, and, nasal, bone, and, pulling, the, two, piece, of, forehead, together, not, only, will, the, hypertelorism, be, solved, by, pulling, the, frontal, bone, closer, together, but, because, of, this, pulling, the, space, between, the, both, part, of, the, maxilla, will, become, wider, box, osteotomy, facial, bipartition, treatment, of, nose, anomaly, edit, the, nose, anomaly, found, in, facial, cleft, vary, the, main, goal, of, the, treatment, is, to, reconstruct, the, nose, to, get, a, functional, and, esthetic, acceptable, result, a, few, possible, treatment, option, are, to, reconstruct, the, nose, with, a, forehead, flap, or, reconstruct, the, nasal, dorsum, with, a, bone, graft, for, example, a, rib, graft, the, nasal, reconstruction, with, a, forehead, flap, is, based, on, the, repositioning, of, a, skin, flap, from, the, forehead, to, the, nose, a, possible, downside, of, this, reconstruction, is, that, once, you, performed, it, at, a, younger, age, you, lengthen, the, flap, at, a, later, stage, a, second, operation, is, often, needed, if, the, operation, is, done, on, early, age, because, the, nose, ha, a, restricted, growth, in, the, cleft, area, repair, of, the, ala, wing, of, the, nose, often, requires, the, inset, of, cartilage, graft, commonly, taken, from, the, ear, treatment, of, midface, anomaly, edit, the, treatment, of, soft, tissue, part, of, midface, anomaly, is, often, a, reconstruction, from, a, skin, flap, of, the, cheek, this, skinflap, can, be, used, for, other, operation, in, the, further, a, it, can, be, raised, again, and, transposed, again, in, the, treatment, of, midface, anomaly, there, are, generally, more, operation, needed, bone, tissue, reconstruction, of, the, midface, often, occurs, later, than, the, soft, tissue, reconstruction, the, most, common, method, to, reconstruct, the, midface, is, by, using, the, incision, line, described, by, le, fort, when, the, cleft, involves, the, maxilla, it, is, likely, that, the, impaired, growth, will, result, in, a, smaller, maxillary, bone, in, all, dimension, height, projection, width, treatment, of, mouth, anomaly, edit, there, are, several, option, for, treatment, of, mouth, anomaly, like, tessier, cleft, number, these, cleft, are, also, seen, in, various, syndrome, like, treacher, collins, syndrome, and, hemifacial, microsomia, which, make, the, treatment, much, more, complicated, in, this, case, treatment, of, mouth, anomaly, is, a, part, of, the, treatment, of, the, syndrome, prevention, edit, because, the, cause, of, facial, cleft, still, is, unclear, it, is, difficult, to, say, what, may, prevent, child, being, born, with, facial, cleft, it,

what, is, typically, found, in, one, area, to, another, area, it, can, also, be, further, expanded, to, a, subtle, form, of, exaptation, where, a, gene, product, used, for, one, underlying, purpose, in, a, diverse, group, of, organism, can, repeatedly, to, produce, seemingly, paraphyletic, distribution, of, trait, but, actual, phylogenetic, analysis, support, a, monophyletic, model, a, doe,

in, the, location, of, expression, chitin, speculative, but, however, chitin, synthase, is, maintained, in, many, lineage, where, it, doe, not, have, an, obvious, macroscopic, function, it, is,

occurrence, throughout, time, molecular, analysis, show, that, protein, that, seem, to, have, a, single, specific, function, are, instead, found, in, many, different, tissue, type, one, example, of,

named, the, syndrome, is, strongly, believed, to, be, inherited, in, an, recessive, manner, when, a, female, carry, a, mutated, gene, on, one, of, her, two, copy, of, the, x, chromosome, there, is, a, chance, of, passing, the, mutation, on, to, her, child, much, like, her, a, daughter, inheriting, this, mutation, will, be, a, carrier, but, will, not, herself, have, the, associated, disease, however, a, son, who, inherits, the, mutation, will, have, the, disease, this, is, because, male, have, only, one, copy, of, the, x, chromosome, and, therefore, could, only, express, the, disease, mutation, this, form, of, inheritance, for, nasodigitoacoustic, syndrome, is, not, yet, absolute, though, a, a, girl, ha, been, reported, with, the, disorder, it, is, suggested, that, further,
